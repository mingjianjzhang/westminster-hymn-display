298 起来我魂起来
1 起来，我魂！起来，
 抛开恐惧心情； 
 宝血已流出来， 
 替我担罪受刑。 
 我的中保座前站立， 
 我的名字刻祂掌里。 
 我的名字刻祂掌里。 
2 祂是长远活着， 
 代求使我也活， 
 祂爱救赎了我， 
 宝血我担过， 
 祂血曾我们流过， 
 如今洒于施恩宝座。 
 如今洒于施恩宝座。 
3 祂在加略山上， 
 身受五处创伤， 
 有效祷告献上， 
 神前为我求讲； 
 “他已赦免！他已释放！  既蒙救赎，当免死亡！”   既蒙救赎，当免死亡！”  
4 天父听祂代求， 
 祂的受膏爱子； 
 神不能拒接受， 
 祂的心爱儿子。 
 祂灵回答宝血求恳， 
 细语告我是神所生。 
5 我己与神和好， 
 听见祂宽恕声； 
 作神儿女蒙召， 
 不让疑惑丛生； 
 我今坦然满怀信心， 
 前来呼叫：”阿爸！父神！”   前来呼叫：”阿爸！父神！”  
298 ARISE MY SOUL ARISE
1 Arise, my soul, arise! 
 Shake off thy guilty fears; 
 The bleeding Sacrifice 
 In my behalf appears. 
 Before the throne my Surety stands,  My name is written on His hands,  My name is written on His hands, 
2 He ever lives above 
 For me to intercede, 
 His all-redeeming love, 
 His precious blood to plead. 
 His blood was shed for all our race,  And sprinkles now the throne of grace.  And sprinkles now the throne of grace. 
3 Five bleeding wounds He bears,  Received on Calvary; 
 They pour effectual prayers; 
 They strongly speak for me. 
 Forgive Him, Oh, forgive, they cry,  Nor let that ransomed sinner die!  Nor let that ransomed sinner die! 
4 The Father hears Him pray, 
 His dear anointed One; 
 He cannot turn away 
 The presence of His Son. 
 His Spirit answers to the blood,  And tells me I am born of God. 
5 My God is reconciled, 
 His pardoning voice I hear; 
 He owns me for His child, 
 I can no longer fear. 
 With confidence I now draw nigh,  And Father, Abba, Father, cry.  And Father, Abba, Father, cry.

299 坦然无惧来到神前
1 “坦然无惧来到神前，”   不知从何说起！ 
 一个罪人因着恩典， 
 竟不再作仇敌！ 
2 我性、我行，都远离神！  哦，离神何等远！ 
 现今因我信血受恩， 
 不再相隔天渊。 
3 我极近神，近到如此，  不能更加相近； 
 我因藉着祂的儿子， 
 得像子那么亲。 
4 神极爱我，爱到如此，  不能再加珍爱； 
 祂是如何爱祂儿子， 
 爱我并不稍改。 
5 我既得着这样的神， 
 我心为何畏避？ 
 祂之于我一往情深， 
 对我说：”我属你！”  
299 A MIND AT PERFECT PEACE WITH GOD
1 A mind at perfect peace with God; 
 O what a word is is this! 
 A sinner reconciled through blood; 
 This, this indeed is peace. 
2 By nature and by practice far, 
 How very far from God; 
 Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him, 
 Through faith in Jesus’ blood. 
3 So nigh, so very nigh to God, 
 I cannot nearer be; 
 For in the person of His Son 
 I am as near as He. 
4 So dear, so very dear to God, 
 More dear I cannot be; 
 The love wherewith He loves the Son, 
 Such is His love to me. 
5 Why should I ever anxious be, 
 Since such a God is mine? 
 He watches o’er me night and day, 
 And tells me “Mine is thine.”

 But judged it once for all; 
 His righteous fury, not on us, 
 But on His Lamb did fall. 
 A new and living way is made —  
 We stand on legal ground; 
 Our Surety and our Substitute 
 Has pardon for us found.

 Redemption now enjoy; 
 Thy precious blood again we see, 
 Its virtue now employ.

 Unlimited and free. 
 Oh, Lamb of God, we’ll sing Thy praise,  Through all eternity!

307 I REMEMBER WHEN MY BURDENS ROLLED  AWAY
1 IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
The Joy of Salvation

 When I sought the blessed Lord, 
 And I took Him at His word, 
 Then at once all my burdens rolled away. 
(C) Rolled away, rolled away, 
 I am happy since my burdens rolled away; 
 Rolled away, rolled away, 
 I am happy since my burdens rolled away. 
2 I remember when my burdens rolled away, 
 That I feared would never leave, night or day; 
 Jesus showed to me the loss, 
 So I left them at the cross; 
 I was glad when my burdens rolled away. 
3 I remember when my burdens rolled away, 
 That had hindered me for years, night and day; 
 As I sought the throne of grace, 
 Just a glimpse of Jesus’ face, 
 And I knew that my burdens could not stay.

 There’s a song within my heart, night and day; 
 I am living for my King, 
 And with joy I shout and sing 
 Hallelu, all my burdens rolled away.

4 脱离了一切苦恼和恐惧，  脱离了一切焦急、忧虑，  在主基督里，何等的欢愉，  我的众锁炼，祂已除去！

4 用尽声音：  我是一个罪人蒙主恩！

 And what His grace can do for you. 
(C) Saved by His pow’r divine, 
 Saved to new life sublime! 
 Life now is sweet and my joy is complete, 
 For I’m saved, saved, saved! 
2 He saves me from every sin and harm, 
 Secures my soul each day; 
 I’m leaning strong on His mighty arm; 
 I know He’ll guide me all the way. 
3 When poor and needy and all alone, 
 In love He said to me, 
 “Come unto Me and I’ll lead you home, 
 To live with Me eternally.”

314 我父独 1 超绝全能
1 我父独 1 超绝、全能， 
 人都无法否认； 
 祂是大能、奇事的神， 
 显在天上星辰。 
和 星宿陈列天空，乃是神迹奇事，  地球悬在太空，也是神迹奇事；  但祂救我灵魂， 
 全人得医治， 
 更是祂恩、爱的神迹奇事！ 
2 虽然祂荣耀已显现， 
 我们仍难尽见 
 祂大能的作为无限， 
 须永世才完全。 
3 圣经处处告诉我们， 
 祂的智慧权能； 
 一花一鸟，在在证明， 
 祂的全智、全能。 
314 MY FATHER IS OMNIPOTENT
1 My Father is omnipotent, 
 And that you can’t deny; 
 A God of might and miracles —  
 ‘Tis written in the sky. 
(C) It took a miracle to put the stars in place,  It took a miracle to hang the world in space;  But when he saved my soul, 
 Cleansed and made me whole, 
 It took a miracle of love and grace! 
2 Though here His glory has been shown,  We still can’t fully see 
 The wonders of His might, His throne —   ‘Twill take eternity. 
3 The Bible tells us of His power 
 And wisdom all way through, 
 And every little bird and flower 
 Are testimonies too.
315 慈爱怜悯祂来寻我
1 慈爱怜悯，祂来寻我，  降世为要将我得着。  祂从罪恶、羞耻深壑，  藉恩救拔了我。
和 从沉沦中，祂救拔我！  用祂慈手救拔了我！  今入光明，黑夜已过！  赞美主名，祂救拔我！ 
2 我不识祂，祂来召我，  激动我心，开我心锁，  发出恩言，免我罪过，  是祂救拔了我！ 
3 头上荆冕，将祂刺伤，  手脚被钉，枪扎肋旁！  赦我罪愆，担我忧伤，  祂爱救拔了我。 
4 我今住在安稳高处，  我魂深感安息、满足；  但我仍然无法说出：  为何祂救拔我。 
315 IN LOVING KINDNESS JESUS CAME
1 In loving kindness Jesus came 
 My soul in mercy to reclaim, 
 And from the depths of sin and shame 
 Thro’ grace He lifted me. 
(C) From sinking sand He lifted me, 
 With tender hand He lifted me, 
 From shades of night to plains of light, 
 Oh, praise His name, He lifted me! 
2 He called me long before I heard, 
 Before my sinful heart was stirred, 
 But when I took Him at His word, 
 Forgiv’n, He lifted me. 
3 His brow was pierced with many a thom, 
 His hands by cruel nails were tom, 
 When from my guilt and grief, forlorn, 
 In love He lifted me. 
4 Now on a higher plane I dwell, 
 And with my soul I know ‘tis well; 
 Yet how or why, I cannot tell, 
 He should have lifted me.
316 耶稣奇妙的救恩
1 特.和.
救恩的喜乐──藉恩得救 
1 耶稣奇妙的救恩， 
 远超我众过犯； 
 我怎能将它述说， 
 更将从何颂赞？ 
 祂除我罪、担我忧， 
 使我灵得自由； 
 耶稣奇妙的救恩，使我得拯救。 
和 主耶稣奇妙无比的救恩，  比广阔雄伟海洋还深；  高逾最高山巅， 
 涌流有如泉源， 
 救恩临及我丰满无限；  阔越我一生所行的过犯，  大过我一切罪恶亏欠。  哦，我要颂扬耶稣宝贵之名，  赞祂名！ 
2 耶稣奇妙的救恩， 
 遍及失丧罪徒； 
 藉此我已蒙赦免， 
 并救我到永古。 
 祂解开我的捆绑， 
 使我得着自由； 
 耶稣奇妙的救恩，使我得拯救。 
316 WONDERFUL GRACE OF JESUS IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS The Joy of Salvation
1 Wonderful grace of Jesus, 
 Greater than all my sin; 
 How shall my tongue describe it, 
 Where shall its praise begin? 
 Taking away my burden, 
 Setting my spirit free; 
 For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me. 
(C) Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,  Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;  Higher than the mountain, 
 sparkling like a fountain, 
 All sufficient grace for even me, 
 Broader than the scope of my transgressions,  Greater far than all my sin and shame.  O magnify the precious name of Jesus,  Praise His name! 
2 Wonderful grace of Jesus, 
 Reaching to all the lost, 
 By it I have been pardoned, 
 Saved to the uttermost, 
 Chains have been torn asunder, 
 Giving me liberty; 
 For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

317 惊人恩典何等甘甜
1 惊人恩典！何等甘甜，  来救无赖如我！ 
 前曾失落，今被寻见！  前盲，今不摸索！ 
2 恩典教导我心惧怕，  又将惧怕除掉； 
 恩典在我初信刹那，  显为何等可宝。 
3 主已应许向我施恩，  祂话就是保证； 
 祂要作我盾牌、永分，  带我经过此生。 
4 历经艰险、劳碌、痛苦，  我今前来就祂； 
 恩典领我跋涉长途，  并要带我回家。 
5 当我见主万年之后，  仍像太阳照耀， 
 比我开始赞美时候，  赞美仍不减少。 
317 AMAZING GRACE HOW SWEET THE SOUND
1 Amazing grace! how sweet the sound, 
 That saved a wretch like me! 
 I once was lost, but now am found, 
 Was blind, but now I see. 
2 ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
 And grace my fears relieved; 
 How precious did that grace appear 
 The hour I first believed! 
3 The Lord hath promised good to me, 
 His word my hope secures; 
 He will my shield and portion be 
 As long as life endures. 
4 Through many dangers, toils and snares, 
 I have already come; 
 ‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, 
 And grace will lead me home. 
5 When we’ve been there ten thousand years, 
 Bright shining as the sun, 
 We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise 
 Than when we first begun.
318 何等宝贵耶稣我救主君王
1 何等宝贵！耶稣我救主、君王，  我心乐极，终日赞美并歌唱；  紧靠着祂，我软弱变为刚强，  祂之于我，何等宝贵！ 
和 祂之于我，何等宝贵，  祂之于我，何等宝贵；  认识我救主，使我魂乐似飞，  祂之于我何等宝贵。 
2 或雨、或晴，祂站在我心门边，  耐心等待，直等我心甘情愿，  实在可耻，竟让祂久候外面；  祂之于我，何等宝贵！ 
3 我终于得站在有福的山岭，  晴空无云，不再有黑暗阴影；  向我微笑，幽谷终于成过境，  祂之于我，何等宝贵！ 
4 我赞美祂，因赐我福分在天，  有朝一日，藉祂恩典中的信，  我要见祂，我要瞻仰祂荣脸，  祂之于我，何等宝贵！ 
318 SO PRECIOUS IS JESUS MY SAVIOR MY  KING
11.11.11.8. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King, 
 His praise all the day long with rapture I sing; 
 To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling,  For He is so precious to me. 
(C) For He is so precious to me, 
 For He is so precious to me; 
 ‘Tis heaven below My Redeemer to know, 
 For He is so precious to me. 
2 He stood at my heart’s door ‘mid sunshine and rain,  And patiently waited an entrance to gain; 
 What shame that so long He entreated in vain, 
 For He is so precious to me. 
3 I stand on the mountain of blessing at last, 
 No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast; 
 His smile is upon me, the valley is past, 
 For He is so precious to me. 
4 I praise Him because He appointed a place, 
 Where, some day, thro’ faith in His wonderful grace,  I know I shall see Him, shall look on His face, 
 For He is so precious to me.
319 来阿你这万福泉源
1 来阿，你这万福泉源！  调整我心来歌唱； 
 怜悯江河涌流不断，  召我高声来颂扬。 
2 我本外人离神流浪，  基督亲来寻找我； 
 因要救我脱离死亡，  祂竟为我被钉戳。 
3 我今天天被你激励，  对你恩典来负债； 
 我主，让此恩典维系  我这流浪的心怀。 
4 我认我是趋向流浪，  趋向离开爱的神； 
 但你竟用圣灵力量，  将我荡心来吸引。 
5 我今已得宝血救恩，  脱离罪恶和死亡； 
 但愿能作脱俗的人，  显出神子的景况。 
319 COME THOU FOUNT OF EV’RY BLESSING
1 Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing, 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; 
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
 Call for songs of loudest praise. 
2 Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
 Wand’ring from the fold of God; 
 He to save my soul from danger, 
 Interposed His precious blood. 
3 Oh to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I’m constrained to be! 
 Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, 
 Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee. 
4 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; 
 Prone to leave the God I love; 
 Take my heart, Oh, take and seal it 
 With Thy Spirit from above. 
5 Rescued thus from sin and danger, 
 Purchased by the Savior’s blood, 
 May I walk on earth a stranger, 
 As a son and heir of God.
320 多年过着虚妄的生活
1 多年过着虚妄的生活，  不理我主如何被钉戳，  不知祂死原是为着我，  在加略山。
和 广大怜悯，白白的恩典；  众多罪愆，我全得赦免，  得着释放脱去了重担，  在加略山。 
2 蒙神光照，得知我罪愆，  恐惧战兢，在律法跟前，  直到我心完全的回转，  向加略山。 
3 今将一切，全都献给主，  甘心乐意作祂的奴仆，  永远不忘祂所受的苦，  在加略山。 
4 哦！爱何大，筹划了救恩！  哦！恩何丰，将此带给人！  哦！力何强，带我归向神，  在加略山。 
320 YEARS I SPENT IN VANITY AND PRIDE
1 Years I spent in vanity and pride, 
 Caring not my Lord was crucified, 
 Knowing not it was for me he died 
 On Calvary. 
(C) Mercy there was great, and grace was free; 
 Pardon there was multiplied to me; 
 There my burdened soul found liberty, 
 At Calvary. 
2 By God’s Word at last my sin I learned; 
 Then I trembled at the law I’d spumed, 
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned 
 To Calvary. 
3 Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus everything, 
 Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
 Now my raptured soul can only sing 
 Of Calvary. 
4 Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan! 
 Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! 
 Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span 
 At Calvary !

1 永不干涸的活泉；
 地上一切全都未能如我愿 -   无何能使我心满。

 我的喜乐之杯满溢而流淌，  基督已使我心满。

 向这医治活泉，我心必全倾，  直到永世不稍渝。 
322 MANY WEARY YEARS I VAINLY SOUGHT A  SPRING
11.7.11.7. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 Many weary years I vainly sought a spring, 
 One that never would run dry; 
 Unavailing all that earth to me could bring, 
 Nothing seemed to satisfy. 
(C) Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry, 
 Drinking at the Fountain of life am I; 
 Finding joy and pleasure 
 In abounding measure, 
 I am drinking at the Fountain of life. 
2 Thro’ the desert land of sin I roam no more, 
 For I find a living Spring, 
 And my cup of gladness now is running o’er, 
 Jesus is my Lord and King. 
3 Here is sweet contentment as the days go by, 
 Here is holy peace and rest; 
 Here is consolation as the moments fly, 
 Here my heart is always blest. 
4 Here I find a never ending, sure supply, 
 While the endless ages roll; 
 To this healing Fountain I would ever fly, 
 There to bathe my weary soul.
323 我曾听见耶稣说道
1 我曾听见耶稣说道：  “来就我得安息，
 疲倦人哪， 
 你头当靠在我的胸怀里。”   照我本相，今来就主：  困苦、流离、忧伤；  我在主里得着安抚，  祂使我心欢畅！ 
2 我曾听见主耶稣说：  “我白赐给活水， 
 凡干渴者都可来喝，  得享生命美味。”  
 因此我来就主耶稣，  畅饮生命水泉， 
 我渴顿止，我魂立苏，  今活在祂里面。 
3 我曾听见耶稣说道：  “我是世上的光， 
 注目于我，幽暗即消，  这光终日明亮。”  
 我仰望主，立得光照，  祂是晨星、太阳； 
 生命之光，时时引导，  一生照耀辉煌。 
323 I HEARD THE VOICE OF JESUS SAY
1 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
 “Come unto Me, and rest; 
 Lay down, thou weary one, lay down 
 Thy head upon My breast.” 
 I came to Jesus as I was, 
 Weary, and worn, and sad; 
 I found in Him a resting-place, 
 And He has made me glad. 
2 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
 “Behold, I freely give 
 The living water: thirsty one, 
 Stoop down, and drink, and live.” 
 I came to Jesus, and I drank 
 Of that life-giving stream; 
 My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,  And now I live in Him. 
3 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
 “I am this dark world’s Light; 
 Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise, 
 And all thy days be bright.” 
 I looked to Jesus, and I found 
 In Him my Star, my Sun; 
 And in that Light of life I’ll walk 
 Till trav’lling days are done.
324 前在埃及为罪奴仆不知何为自由 特.和.
1 前在埃及为罪奴仆，不知何为自由；  良心常有罪的重负，无处得拯救。  如今属地事物缠累，对我再无关系；  无何能使我离荣美之地。 
和 今我登巍巍高山，在光天化日之中，  今我饮滚滚活泉，长年涌流无终，  今我得丰富，地满乳蜜，路滴脂油，  恩重重，乐哉！今我居荣美之地。 
2 前在埃及疑虑风暴，时常将我吹袭；  仇敌军兵不断搅扰，我几不能敌。  今我有主话为堡垒，在其中享安息；  无何困我，在此荣美之地。 
3 疑虑风暴尽管吹袭，我今不再畏惧；  神的能手足以护庇，我在此安居。  在此日光经常照耀， 
 再无祸害临及； 
 何等安然，在此荣美之地。 
4 我今默念神的作为，何等甘甜、满足；  祂的恩言将我安慰，祂领我一路。  灵中享受完全救恩，其乐无何可比；  我爱长久居此荣美之地。 
324 FAR AWAY THE NOISE OF STRIFE UPON  MY EAR IS FALLING
1 IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
The Joy of Salvation 
1 Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,  Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;  Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,  None of these shall move me from *Beulah Land. * Meaning,  married ( Isa, 62:4). 
(C) I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,  I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;  O yes, I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,  For I am dwelling in Beulah Land. 
2 Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,  Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;  Safe am I within the castle of God’s word retreating,  Nothing then can reach me, ‘tis Beulah Land. 
3 Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,  I am safely sheltered here, protected by God’s hand;  Here the sun is always shining, here there’s 
 naught can harm me, 
 I am safe forever in Beulah Land. 
4 Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,  Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;  Dwelling in the spirit, here I learn of full salvation,  Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
325 有平安在我心非世界所能赐
1 有平安在我心，非世界所能赐，  这平安无人能夺去； 
 虽一生多试炼，如愁云环绕我，  这平安仍在我心永居！ 
和 永远住在我心，耶稣属我；  永远住在我心，无穷喜乐；  祂永不会离弃我，柔声对我说：  “我永不离弃你，”耶稣属我。 
2 当平安满我心，似乎举世歌唱、  赞美我的君王、救主； 
 众愁苦皆逃避，黑夜变为白昼，  何荣耀，何有福，我耶稣！ 
3 当我在这地上，流浪历尽沧桑，  “这宝贝”仍藏我瓦器； 
 哦，荣耀之大日，祂必来提接我，  回天上父家永享安息。 
325 THERE’S A PEACE IN MY HEART THAT THE  WORLD NEVER GAVE
6.6.8.6.6.9. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,  A peace it can not take away; 
 Tho’ the trials of life may surround like a cloud, 
 I’ve a peace that has come there to stay! 
(C) Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine; 
 Constantly abiding, rapture divine; 
 He never leaves me lonely, whispers, 
 O so kind: “I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine. 
2 All the world seemed to sing of a Savior and King,  When peace sweetly came to my heart; 
 Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,  Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art! 
3 This treasure I have in a temple of clay, 
 While here on His footstool I roam; 
 But He’s coming to take me some glorious day, 
 Over there to my heavenly home!

327 基督使我心中喜乐
1 基督使我脱罪捆绑，  今活在地如在天上；  世上虽有困苦、忧伤，  认识耶稣就在天上。
和 阿利路亚，如在天上！  困我捆绑都得释放！  陆地、洋海，不论何方，  耶稣同在就在天上。 
2 世界曾是痛苦深渊，  直到我见救主笑脸，  天即在我心中出现，  并要长存直到永远。 
3 无论我们住在何方，  或在平原，或在山岗，  或居大厦，或住陋房，  耶稣同在就在天上。

1 Since Christ my soul from sin set free,  This world has been a heav’n to me;  And mid earth’s sorrows and its woe,  ‘Tis heav’n my Jesus here to know. 
(C) Oh, hallelujah, yes, ‘tis heav’n,  ‘Tis heav’n to know my sins forgiv’n!  On land or sea, what matters where?  Where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there. 
2 The earth was once a bitter place  Till Jesus showed His smiling face;  Now heaven’s begun within my soul,  ‘Twill last while endless ages roll. 
3 What matters where on earth we dwell?  On mountaintop or in the dell,  In cottage or a mansion fair, 
 Where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.
327 基督使我心中喜乐
1 基督使我心中喜乐，  基督使我口中高歌；  有祂同在，就能欢畅，  有祂同在，就能歌唱！
和 阿利路亚，真能歌唱！  阿利路亚，真能欢畅！  有祂同在，就能欢畅，  有祂同在，就能歌唱！ 
2 祂爱甘甜，激我走路，  祂恩丰满，使我顺服，  祂的爱心，将我拯救，  祂的恩手将我保守。 
3 除祂以外，在天有谁？  除祂以外，在地无归！  祂之爱我，直到万代！  我之爱祂，岂只现在？

3 The hill of Zion yields 
 A thousand sacred sweets 
 Before we reach the heav’nly fields, 
 Before we reach the heav’nly fields, 
 Or walk the golden streets, 
 Or walk the golden streets. 
4 Then let our songs abound 
 And every tear be dry; 
 We’re marching through Emmanuel’s ground,  We’re marching through Emmanuel’s ground,  To fairer worlds on high, 
 To fairer worlds on high.
331 我不以认我主为耻
1 我不以认我主为耻， 
 我乐为祂辩明； 
 我尊重祂话的价值， 
 并以十架为荣。 
2 耶稣，我神！我知祂名， 
 祂名我所仰望； 
 祂必不至让我受窘， 
 也不让我失望。 
3 祂的应许稳如宝座， 
 永远信实可靠， 
 祂能保守我所交托， 
 直等那日来到。 
4 那时祂要在父面前， 
 承认我的微名； 
 在新耶路撒冷里面， 
 我魂永享安宁。 
331 I’M NOT ASHAMED TO OWN MY LORD
1 I’m not ashamed to own my Lord, 
 Or to defend His cause, 
 Maintain the honor of His Word, 
 The glory of His cross. 
2 Jesus, my God! I know His name, 
 His Name is all my trust; 
 Nor will He put my soul to shame, 
 Nor let my hope be lost. 
3 Firm as His throne His promise stands, 
 And He can well secure 
 What I’ ve committed to His hands, 
 Till the decisive hour. 
4 Then will He own my worthless name 
 Before His Father’s face; 
 And, in the New Jerusalem, 
 Appoint my soul a place.
332 今有荣光照耀我魂间
1 今有荣光照耀我魂间，  胜于星月太阳；
 光线清新，辉煌又灿烂，  因主就是这光。 
和 荣耀之光！福乐之光！  带来平安喜乐滚滚浪；  当主耶稣笑脸欣欣放，  荣耀之光照明亮。 
2 今有音乐洋溢我魂间，  颂赞我主我王； 
 恩主在听，且也会听见，  尽管我拙于唱。 
3 今有平安弥漫我魂间，  因主在我心房； 
 平安之鸽吟于我心坎，  恩典之花开放。 
4 今有喜乐充满我魂间，  且有颂赞、盼望； 
 因主向我既已施恩典，  又储喜乐天上。 
332 THERE IS SUNSHINE IN MY SOUL TODAY
1 There is sunshine in my soul today, 
 More glorious and bright 
 Than glows in any earthly sky, 
 For Jesus is my light. 
(C) O there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine, 
 While the peaceful, happy moments roll; 
 When Jesus shows His Smiling face 
 There is sunshine in my soul. 
2 There is music in my soul today, 
 A carol to my King; 
 And Jesus, listening, can hear 
 The song I cannot sing. 
3 There is springtime in my soul today, 
 For when the Lord is near 
 The dove of peace sings in my heart, 
 The flowers of grace appear. 
4 There is gladness in my soul today, 
 And hope, and praise, and love, 
 For blessings which He gives me now,  
 For joys laid up above.
333 谁如耶稣使我心乐
1 谁如耶稣使我心乐，  藉祂神圣的同在？
 信实、温柔、纯洁、宝贵，  祂今成为我心爱！ 
和 惟主耶稣感动我心，  宝贵远胜我生命； 
 千万人中祂是最美，  配得永远的赞美。 
2 基督的爱白白得到，  神的恩典无限量； 
 怜悯远比诸天还高，  深逾洋海难尽享。 
3 何等奇妙救赎恩典，  非人心所能知觉； 
 我罪孽虽红如丹颜，  也必洗净白如雪。 
4 祂的恩手供应无缺，  祂的美善我全阅； 
 祂的能力使我安歇，  祂之于我是一切。 
5 在那明亮生命河边，  我与赎民同歌唱， 
 此歌何甜唱到永远，  赞美荣耀我君王。 
333 WHO CAN CHEER THE HEART LIKE JESUS
1 Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, 
 By His presence all divine? 
 True and tender, pure and precious, 
 O how blest to call Him mine! 
(C) All that thrills my soul is Jesus, 
 He is more than life to me; 
 And the fairest of ten thousand, 
 In my blessed Lord I see. 
2 Love of Christ so freely given, 
 Grace of God beyond degree, 
 Mercy higher than the heaven, 
 Deeper than the deepest sea. 
3 What a wonderful redemption! 
 Never can a mortal know 
 How my sin, tho’ red like crimson, 
 Can be whiter than the snow. 
4 Ev’ry need His hand supplying, 
 Ev’ry good in Him I see; 
 On His strength divine relying, 
 He is all in all to me. 
5 By the crystal flowing river 
 With the ransomed I will sing, 
 And forever and forever 
 Praise and glorify the King.
334 我宁愿有耶稣胜于金银
1 我宁愿有耶稣，胜于金银，  我宁属耶稣，胜过财富无穷；  我宁愿有耶稣，胜过地土，  愿主钉痕手，引导我前途。 
和 胜过作君王，虽统治万方，  却仍受罪恶捆绑； 
 我宁愿有耶稣，胜于世上  荣华、富贵、声望。 
2 我宁愿有耶稣，胜于称扬，  我宁忠于主，满足主的心肠；  我宁愿有耶稣，胜于美名，  愿对主忠诚，宣扬主圣名。 
3 祂比珍贵百合更加美丽，  祂真是甘甜，远胜蜂房滴蜜；  我的饥灵所需，祂全供应，  我宁有耶稣，跟随祂率领。 
334 I’D RATHER HAVE JESUS THAN SILVER OR  GOLD
10.11.10.10. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold, 
 I’d rather be His than have riches 
 I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands, 
 I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand. 
(C) Than to be the king of a vast domain, 
 And be held in sin’s dread sway; 
 I’d rather have Jesus than anything, 
 This world affords today. 
2 I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause, 
 I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause; 
 I’d rather have Jesus than world wide fame, 
 I’d rather be true to His holy name. 
3 He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom, 
 He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb; 
 He’s all that my hungering spirit needs, 
 I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
335 远在高天神宝座前
1 远在高天神宝座前， 
 我有一位强力中保； 
 这大祭司，祂名是爱， 
 长远活着，为我代祷。 
2 祂将我名刻在祂手， 
 又将我名记在心里； 
 祂今在天站立神右， 
 谁也不能将我驱离。 
3 撒但在我心里控告， 
 企图使我丧气、绊跌， 
 但我向祂举目仰望， 
 祂已除去我的罪孽。 
4 无罪之主既已受死， 
 我这罪人就得自由； 
 公义的神今已满足， 
 看见救主，祂就赦宥。 
5 看哪，复活羔羊在天， 
 是我完全、无疵义裳， 
 是那永不改变”我是”， 
 是我荣耀、恩典君王。 
6 与祂合一，我不再死， 
 祂的宝血将我赎回； 
 我的生命与主同藏， 
 藏在救主、我神之内。 
335 BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE
1 Before the throne of God above 
 I have a strong, a perfect plea; 
 A great High Priest, whose Name is Love, 
 Who ever lives and pleads for me. 
2 My name is graven on His hands, 
 My name is written on His heart; 
 I know that while in heaven He stands 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart. 
3 When Satan tempts me to despair, 
 And tells me of the guilt within, 
 Upward I look, and see Him there 
 Who made an end of all my sin. 
4 Because the sinless Savior died, 
 My sinful soul is counted free; 
 For God, the Just, is satisfied 
 To look on Him and pardon me. 
5 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb! 
 My perfect, spotless Righteousness, 
 The great unchangeable I AM, 
 The King of glory and of grace. 
6 One with Himself, I cannot die; 
 My soul is purchased by His blood; 
 My life is hid with Christ on high, 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God.
336 你里完全亲爱救主
1 你里完全，亲爱救主，
 我的工作，都不算数； 
 你的宝血，买来赦免， 
 我今在你，才得完全。 
和 我被称义，何等有福， 
 又得成圣，救恩稳固！ 
 你的宝血，买来赦免， 
 我将得荣，同你掌权。 
2 你里完全，藉你恩典， 
 罪恶不能再来掌权； 
 你的声音使敌逃窜， 
 我站你里，得以完全。 
3 你里完全，不再缺乏， 
 所有好处我都无差； 
 你是我分，此意何甜， 
 不再他求，你里完全。 
4 亲爱救主，在你面前， 
 万民万族蒙你拣选， 
 我亦有分选民中间， 
 在你右边 - 你里完全。 
336 COMPLETE IN THEE NO WORK OF MINE
1 Complete in Thee! no work of mine 
 May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine; 
 Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, 
 And I am now cornplete in Thee. 
(C) Yea, justified! O blessed thought! 
 And sanctified! Salvation wrought! 
 Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, 
 And glorified, I too, shall be! 
2 no more shall sin,
 Thy grace hath conquered, reign within; 
 Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee, 
 And I shall stand complete in Thee. 
3 each want supplied,
 And no good thing to me denied; 
 Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be, 
 I ask no more, complete in Thee. 
4 Dear Savior! when before Thy bar 
 All tribes and tongues assembled are, 
 Among Thy chosen will I be, 
 At Thy right hand — complete in Thee.
337 我的信心安息之地
1 我的信心安息之地，
 乃是永活救主； 
 既非办法也非道理， 
 祂的伤痕算数。 
和 无需别的说项、辩白， 
 无需另一中保； 
 耶稣受死乃是为我， 
 完全、充分、可靠。 
2 耶稣救我，这已足够 
 消我疑惑恐惧； 
 照我本相，前来依投， 
 祂永不将我拒。 
3 我心信靠主话保证， 
 祂话如此明确： 
 救恩乃藉救主尊名， 
 并因祂的宝血。 
4 至大医生治我病苦， 
 祂来拯救失丧； 
 祂的宝血为我流出， 
 为我舍命木上。 
337 MY FAITH HAS FOUND A RESTING PLACE
1 My faith has found a resting place, 
 Not in device nor creed; 
 I trust the Ever living One, 
 His wounds for me shall plead. 
(C) I need no other argument, 
 I need no other plea; 
 It is enough that Jesus died, 
 And that He died for me. 
2 Enough for me that Jesus saves, 
 This ends my fear and doubt; 
 A sinful soul I come to Him, 
 He’ll never cast me out. 
3 My heart is leaning on the Word, 
 The written Word of God, 
 Salvation by my Savior’s name, 
 Salvation through His blood. 
4 My great Physician heals the sick, 
 The lost He came to save; 
 For me His precious blood He shed, 
 For me His life He gave.
338 交通何甜美喜乐何丰盈
1 交通何甜美，喜乐何丰盈，  安息在那永久膀臂中；
 福气何全备，平安何神圣，  安息在那永久膀臂中。 
和 安息！安息！ 
 平安稳妥，一无惊恐； 
 安息！安息！ 
 安息在那永久膀臂中。 
2 今行这旅程，心中满平安，  安息在那永久膀臂中； 
 越行越光明，恩光照灿烂，  安息在那永久膀臂中。 
3 有何我所惧？有何我所怕？  安息在那永久膀臂中； 
 与主永同居，平安无复加，  安息在那永久膀臂中。 
338 WHAT A FELLOWSHIP WHAT A JOY  DIVINE.
10.9.10.9. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 What a fellowship, what a joy divine. 
 Leaning on the Everlasting Arms! 
 What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, 
 Leaning on the Everlasting Arms! 
(C) Leaning, leaning, 
 Safe and secure from all alarms; 
 Leaning, leaning, 
 Leaning on the Ever lasting Arms. 
2 O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, 
 Leaning on the Everlasting Arms! 
 O how bright the path grows from day to day,  Leaning on the Everlasting Arms! 
3 What have I to dread, what have I to fear, 
 Leaning on the Everlasting Arms! 
 I have peace complete with my Lord so near,  Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!
339 我真不知神的奇恩
1 我真不知神的奇恩
 为何临到我身； 
 我也不知不堪如我， 
 救来有何足多。 
和 惟知道我所信的是谁， 
 并且也深信祂实在是能 
 保守我所信托祂的， 
 都全备直到那日！ 
2 我真不知救我的信， 
 如何进入我心， 
 我也不知何以一信， 
 便得一个新心。 
3 我真不知圣灵如何 
 引人知道己过， 
 并由圣经显明耶稣， 
 使人接祂为主。 
4 我真不知我的前途， 
 到底是甘是苦； 
 我也不知未见主前， 
 还有什么试炼。 
5 我真不知何时主来， 
 那时我是何在 -  
 到底我当经过死谷？ 
 或将空中遇主？ 
339 I KNOW NOT WHY GOD’S WONDROUS  GRACE
8.6.8.6. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 I know not why God’s wondrous grace 
 To me He hath made known, 
 Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love 
 Redeemed me for His own. 
(C) But “I know Whom I have believed 
 And am persuaded that He is able 
 To keep that which I’ve committed 
 Unto Him against that day.” 
2 I know not how this saving faith 
 To me He did impart, 
 Nor how believing in His word 
 Wrought peace within my heart. 
3 I know not how the Spirit moves, 
 Convincing men of sin, 
 Revealing Jesus through the Word, 
 Creating faith in Him. 
4 I know not what of good or ill 
 May be reserved for me, 
 Of weary ways or golden days, 
 Before His face I see. 
5 I know not when my Lord may come, 
 At night or noon-day fair, 
 Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him, 
 Or “meet Him in the air.”
340 你人生航程忽起大风暴
1 你人生航程，忽起大风暴，  你所抛之锚，是否可靠？  狂浪排天来，绳索似不牢，  你锚将随波或不动摇？
和 我心坚定因我锚牢靠， 
 在风浪中仍稳定不摇， 
 因它紧扣在磐石之上， 
 深固主爱里，无比的刚强。 
2 安居良港内，能不惧风浪，  有主的手臂，我永稳当； 
 我心已与祂，永远相联结，  神圣的能力，保守一切。 
3 经险恶海峡，仍勇往无惧，  礁上碎浪声，表明险域； 
 波浪虽凶猛，狂风虽咆哮，  无任何波涛，把我心摇。 
4 死河的寒波，终虽会临到，  但我仍信托，至死可靠； 
 潮水虽高涨，我仍不气馁，  因我的盼望，仍居幔内。 
340 WILL YOUR ANCHOR HOLD IN THE  STORMS OF LIFE
10.9.10.9. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,  When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?  When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,  Will your anchor drift or firm remain? 
(C) We have an anchor that keeps the soul 
 Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,  Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,  Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love. 
2 It is safely moored, ‘twill the storm withstand,  For ‘tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;  And the cables passed from His heart to mine,  Can defy the blast, through strength divine. 
3 It will firmly hold in the straits of fear, 
 When the breakers have told the reef is near;  Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,  Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow. 
4 It will surely hold in the floods of death, 
 When the waters cold chill our latest breath;  On the rising tide it can never fail, 
 While our hopes abide within the veil.
341 我听慈爱的话
1 我听慈爱的话， 
 我见宝血已洒， 
 大能祭物我已看见， 
 与神相安无间。 
2 这是永远安宁！ 
 坚定如主大名， 
 稳固有如神的宝座， 
 永远值得信托。 
3 黑云飘来逝去， 
 狂风横扫天际； 
 宝血之约永不改变， 
 十架常在身边。 
4 爱心时常缺少， 
 喜乐也常难保， 
 但是我与我主之间， 
 平安仍旧不变。 
5 你我容易改变， 
 惟主永活在天； 
 祂爱是我安息之处， 
 祂话将我系住。 
6 祂虽已升高天， 
 十架仍存未变； 
 封墓大石虽已挪移， 
 坟墓仍在那里。 
7 那里是我平安， 
 灾祸全埋里面！ 
 我知神子曾经来过， 
 祂曾死过又活。 
8 我知祂今活着， 
 在神右边坐着； 
 我知祂的宝座在天， 
 真理与爱不变。 
341 I HEAR THE WORDS OF LOVE
1 I hear the words of love, 
 I gaze upon the blood, 
 I see the mighty sacrifice, 
 And I have peace with God. 
2 ‘Tis everlasting peace! 
 Sure as Jehovah’s Name, 
 ‘Tis stable as His steadfast throne, 
 For evermore the same. 
3 The clouds may go and come, 
 And storms may sweep my sky; 
 This blood-sealed friendship changes not,  The Cross is ever nigh. 
4 My love is ofttimes low, 
 My joy still ebbs and flows, 
 But peace with Him remains the same,  No change my Savior knows. 
5 I change, He changes not; 
 The Christ can never die; 
 His love, not mine, the resting-place,  His truth, not mine, the tie. 
6 The Cross still stands unchanged, 
 Though heaven is now His home; 
 The mighty stone is rolled away, 
 But yonder is His tomb! 
7 And yonder is my peace, 
 The grave of all my woes! 
 I know the Son of God has come, 
 I know He died and rose. 
8 I know He liveth now 
 At God’s right hand above; 
 I know the throne on which He sits,  I know His truth and love!
342 何等奇妙救主是耶稣我主
1 何等奇妙救主是耶稣我主，  祂是我的奇妙救主； 
 祂将我魂隐藏在磐石穴中，  其中活水使我满足。 
和 祂将我魂隐藏在磐石穴中，  干渴之地作我荫疪； 
 祂将我生命藏祂爱的深处，  又用祂圣手来遮蔽， 
 又用祂圣手来遮蔽。 
2 何等奇妙救主是耶稣我主，  我的重负祂来担当； 
 祂用手紧握住使我不摇动，  我的一生祂加力量。 
3 时刻祂以恩典为生命冠冕，  以祂丰满注我心中， 
 哦，愿荣耀归神！我欢然歌唱，  向我救赎之主称颂。 
4 以祂光明为衣，我复活变化，  与祂相遇天空云中， 
 要与千万圣徒在高天同颂  祂奇爱和无限恩宠。 
342 A WONDERFUL SAVIOR IS JESUS MY  LORD
11.8.11.8. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 A wonderful Savior to me: 
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
 Where rivers of pleasure I see. 
(C) He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
 That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
 He hideth my life in the depths of His love,  And covers me there with His hand, 
 And covers me there with his hand. 
2 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 He taketh my burden away; 
 He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved, 
 He giveth me strength as my day. 
3 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,  And, filled with his fulness divine, 
 I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God, 
 For such a Redeemer as mine! 
4 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise  To meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
 His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, 
 I’ll shout with the millions on high.

343 我要唱那奇妙故事
1 我要唱那奇妙故事，  是基督为我受死，
 祂曾撇开天上位置，  背十架来替我死。 
和 我要唱那奇妙故事，  是基督为我受死， 
 要在荣耀光中唱诗，  到永世仍不停止。 
2 我曾失丧，祂来寻找，  将迷羊寻回、肩负；  用祂爱臂将我环抱，  引导我走祂义路。 
3 我曾受伤，祂来医治；  我跌倒，祂来扶持；  我心恐惧，目不能视，  今因祂全得开释。 
4 有时黑影来笼罩我，  又常履忧伤路径， 
 但我救主永不离我，  藉祂手安然引领。 
343 I WILL SING THE WONDROUS STORY
1 I will sing the wondrous story 
 Of the Christ who died for me, 
 How He left His home in glory 
 For the cross of Calvary. 
(C) Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story 
 Of the Christ who died for me, 
 Sing it in the light of glory, 
 Sing it through eternity. 
2 I was lost, but Jesus found me, 
 Found the sheep that went astray, 
 Threw His loving arms around me, 
 Drew me back into His way. 
3 I was bruised, but Jesus healed me; 
 Faint was I from many a fall; 
 Sight was gone, and fears possessed me, 
 But He freed me from them all. 
4 Days of darkness still come o’er me, 
 Sorrow’s paths I often tread, 
 But the Savior still is with me; 
 By His hand I’m safely led.
344 为我受伤为我受伤
1 为我受伤，为我受伤，  加略山上，耶稣为我受伤；  罪已赦免，我今得着释放，  都是因着耶稣为我受伤。 
2 为我受死，为我受死，  十字架上，耶稣为我受死；  因祂受死，我知救赎已赐，  都是因着耶稣为我受死。 
3 为我复活，为我复活，  脱离坟墓，基督为我复活；  死亡毒钩，今后不能害我，  都是因着基督为我复活。 
4 为我活着，为我活着，  高天之上，基督为我活着；  替我祈求，天天担我软弱，  都是因着基督为我活着。 
5 为我再来，为我再来，  从天降临，基督为我再来；  何等喜乐，当我见主丰采，  哦，赞美祂！基督为我再来。 
344 WOUNDED FOR ME WOUNDED FOR ME
1 Wounded for me, wounded for me, 
 There on the cross He was wounded for me; 
 Gone my transgressions, and now I am free, 
 All because Jesus was wounded for me. 
2 Dying for me, dying for me, 
 There on the cross He was dying for me; 
 Now in His death my redemption I see, 
 All because Jesus was dying for me. 
3 Risen for me, risen for me, 
 Up from the grave He has risen for me; 
 Now evermore from death’s sting I am free, 
 All because Jesus has risen for me. 
4 Living for me, living for me, 
 Up in the skies He is living for me; 
 Daily He’s pleading and praying for me, 
 All because Jesus is living for me. 
5 Coming for me, coming for me, 
 Soon in the air He is coming for me; 
 Then with what joy His dear face I shall see, 
 Oh, how I praise Him! He’s coming for me.
345 稳固的根基为信徒已建立
1 稳固的根基，为信徒已建立，  在神话语中，其稳固胜天地。  你既投靠主，如投到避难所，  神话就保证你永远是稳妥。 
2 “我与你同在，无需丧胆、恐惧，  因我是你神，仍是你的帮助；  我加力给你，助你站稳不移，  我公义能手，永远将你扶住。”  
3 “我要带领你，经过深水、幽谷，  忧愁的水流，必不将你淹埋；  我必看顾你，苦难转为祝福，  在你受压时，使你圣别、开怀。”  
4 “你被试炼时，我要为你开路，  足够的恩典，要作你的帮助；  火不至伤你，它只烧去杂物，  我安排这火，要将精金炼出。”  
5 “一直到年老，我子民必证实  我主宰权柄，永远不变的爱；  他们的白发，要作头上装饰，  如同众羊羔，安详躺卧我怀。”  
6 “凡靠在我怀寻求安息之人，  我必不将他撇弃给他仇敌；  阴府的全军，虽想摇动这魂，  但我必永不，永不将他丢弃！”  
345 HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION YE SAINTS OF  THE LORD
1 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, 
 Is laid for your faith in His excellent word! 
 What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
 To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled? 
2 “Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed, 
 For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid; 
 I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,  Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand. 
3 “When through the deep waters I call thee to go, 
 The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow; 
 For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
 And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. 
4 “When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, 
 My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply; 
 The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design 
 Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. 
5 “E’en down to old age all My people shall prove 
 My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love; 
 And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,  Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne. 
6 “The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, 
 I will not, I will not desert to his foes; 
 That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,  I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!”
346 站在基督我王一切应许上
1 站在基督我王一切应许上，  千万亿载，都当不住的颂扬，  荣耀归神！我要呼喊并歌唱，  站立在神一切应许上。 
和 站立，站立， 
 站立在神我救主一切应许上；  站立，站立， 
 站立在神一切的应许上。 
2 站在永不能背弃的应许上，  每当怀疑、恐惧攻击如风浪，  靠着神的话语我必能欢唱，  站立在神一切应许上。 
3 站在我今可看见的应许上，  宝血现在使我完全得释放，  基督释放了我使我能欢唱，  站立在神一切应许上。 
4 站在基督我救主的应许上，  爱的绳索将我联祂永不放，  靠着圣灵宝剑每天都刚强，  站立在神一切应许上。 
5 站在使我不跌倒的应许上，  时刻听从圣灵的呼召前往，  救主是我一切，靠祂何安详，  站立在神一切应许上。 
346 STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF CHRIST  MY KING
11.11.11.9. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 Standing on the promises of Christ my king, 
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring, 
 Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing, 
 Standing on the promises of God. 
(C) Standing, standing, 
 Standing on the promises of God my Savior; 
 Standing, standing, 
 I’m standing on the promises of God. 
2 Standing on the promises that cannot fail, 
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, 
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail, 
 Standing on the promises of God. 
3 Standing on the promises I now can see 
 Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me; 
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, 
 Standing on the promises of God. 
4 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, 
 Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord, 
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword, 
 Standing on the promises of God. 
5 Standing on the promises I shall not fall, 
 List’ning ev’ry moment to the Spirit’s call, 
 Resting in my Savior as my All in all, 
 Standing on the promises of God.
347 平安如水流正一路跟随我
1 平安如水流，正一路跟随我；  忧虑如怒涛势汹涌； 
 任何的遭遇，你已教我能说：  哦，我魂，当安息，无所恐！ 
和 哦，我魂，可无恐！ 
 哦，我魂，可安乐、可无恐！ 
2 撒但虽肆虐，试炼虽如烈火，  我心仍应当有把握； 
 因主明了我是何等的软弱，  祂已为我流血成工作。 
3 我罪，哦，这是何等荣耀思想，  我罪，非局部，乃拢总，  全钉祂十架，却不压我身上，  哦，我魂，要称颂、要称颂！ 
4 活着是基督，是基督在执政，  即便那死河起波澜， 
 我也无苦痛，因虽死犹如生，  祂对我正低声赐平安。 
5 我主、我救主，我等候你再临，  我眼是望你，不望墓； 
 号筒要吹响！是我主的声音！  何荣耀的盼望，何有福！ 
347 WHEN PEACE LIKE A RIVER ATTENDETH  MY WAY
11.8.11.9. WITH CHORUS 
The Joy of Salvation 
1 When peace like a river attendeth my way, 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll; 
 Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say, 
 “It is well, it is well with my soul!” 
(C) It is well with my soul! 
 It is well, it is well with my soul! 
2 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,  Let this blest assurance control, 
 That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
 And hath shed His own blood for my soul. 
3 My sin, not in part, but the whole,
 Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more; 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! 
4 For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live; 
 If dark hours about me shall roll, 
 No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life 
 Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul. 
5 And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,  The clouds be rolled back as a scroll, 
 The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,  “Even so” — it is well with my soul.
348 哦神你的大爱来激励我
1 哦神，你的大爱来激励我，  如同潮水涌进我的心怀，  如活水江河从我魂流过，  冲去我里面一切的障碍。 
2 我怎能不服你大爱能力？  我怎能不让爱潮进我心？  你的温柔满了降服能力，  使我生命从此有了更新。 
3 属天的爱破碎我的天然，  清扫我心中的每一思路，  纯净我意志，满溢我情感，  除你纯净生命，别无他物。 
4 愿我全人被神占有、管理，  使你生命从我不绝流出，  恩典、柔爱之河畅流不息，  我们爱，是因神爱的缘故。 
348 THY MIGHTY LOVE O GOD CONSTRAINETH  ME
1 Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me, 
 As some strong tide it preseth on its way, 
 Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul, 
 Yearning to sweep all barriers away. 
2 Shall I not yield to that constraining power? 
 Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in? 
 My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me, 
 Life cannot be as it hath hither been. 
3 Break through my nature, mighty heavenly love, 
 Clear every avenue of thought and brain, 
 Flood my affections, purify my will, 
 Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain. 
4 Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God, 
 Forth from my life, spontaneous and free, 
 Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace, 
 Loving, because God loved, eternally.
349 让我爱你因你配得
1 让我爱你，因你配得 
 我心所有的感觉； 
 爱的能力把我驱策， 
 向你奉献我一切； 
 人生重担变成轻省， 
 人间忧愁不伤感， 
 负担若为讨你欢心， 
 痛苦为得你笑脸。 
和 让我爱你，救主！我心所喜所慕，  献上此心给主，叫你心满意足。 
2 让我爱你，求主启示， 
 你爱所作的一切； 
 助我不信恶心认识 
 你在十架的情节。 
 让我见你因爱不顾 
 为我罪愆受羞辱； 
 因你所受痛苦领悟 
 何等重价为我付。 
3 我的良人，
 爱你是我最欢喜； 
 无论晴朗，或是忧闷， 
 我在你里能安息。 
 但若无你，人生乏味， 
 美丽花卉失香味； 
 得你，就得永迼远恩惠， 
 离你，一切变虚伪。 
4 让我爱你，爱使我能 
 不受思想的支配； 
 使我正直行完旅程， 
 鞠躬事你到尽瘁： 
 爱能安慰所有伤悲， 
 爱能减轻每重担， 
 爱能完全顺服跟随， 
 爱能高歌并勇敢。 
349 LET ME LOVE THEE THOU ART CLAIMING
1 Let me love Thee, Thou art claiming 
 Every feeling of my soul; 
 Let that love in pow’r prevailing, 
 Render Thee my life, my all; 
 For life’s burdens they are easy, 
 And life’s sorrows lose their sting, 
 If they’re carried, Lord, to please Thee, 
 If their pain Thy smile should win. 
(C) Let me love Thee, Savior, Take my heart forever,  Nothing but Thy favor My soul can satisfy. 
2 Let me love Thee, come revealing 
 All Thy love has done for me; 
 Help my heart, so unbelieving, 
 By the sight of Calvary: 
 Let me see Thy love despising 
 All the shame my sins had brought; 
 By Thy torments realizing 
 What a price my pardon bought. 
3 Let me love Thee, I am gladdest 
 When I’m loving Thee, the best; 
 For in sunshine or in sadness 
 I can find in Thee a rest; 
 But without Thee life is fading, 
 Treasureless its choicest flowers; 
 Taken are its gifts eternal; 
 Left, its empty passing hours. 
4 Let me love Thee, love is mighty, 
 Swaying realms of deed and thought; 
 By it I shall walk uprightly, 
 I shall serve Thee as I ought: 
 Love will soften every sorrow, 
 Love will lighten every care, 
 Love unquestioning will follow, 
 Love will triumph, love will dare.

350 耶稣耶稣我的性命
1 耶稣，耶稣，我的性命，  因为爱的缘故，
 求原谅我，将你圣名，  日念千遍不住。 
和 耶稣，耶稣，最爱救主，  无人无物与你比拟，  你的笑容是我欢喜，  我爱，爱你，你，主！ 
2 我心爱你，不知如何  约束我的奇乐； 
 你爱有如一团热火，  使我心中火热。 
3 因你是我一切一切，  我的荣耀、财富， 
 我身力量、我心所悦，  我魂永远满足。 
4 烧、烧，哦爱，在我心怀，  日夜厉害的烧， 
 直至所有其他的爱 
 烧到无处可找。 
5 暗中之光、忧中之乐、  天在地上开始； 
 耶稣，你是我爱、我歌，  有谁知你价值！ 
6 这爱将受什么限制？  要到那里停止？ 
 进，进，我主，甘甜价值  今日远胜昨日。 
350 O JESUS JESUS DEAREST LORD
1 O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord! 
 Forgive me if I say, 
 For very love, Thy sacred name 
 A thousand times a day. 
 O Jesus, Lord, with me abide; 
(C) I rest in Thee, whate’er betide; 
 Thy gracious smile is my reward; 
 I love, I love Thee, Lord.! 
2 I love Thee so I know not how 
 My transports to control; 
 Thy love is like a burning fire 
 Within my very soul. 
3 For Thou to me art all in all; 
 My honor and my wealth; 
 My heart’s desire, my body’s strength,  My soul’s eternal health. 
4 Burn, bum, O love, within my heart, 
 Burn fiercely night and day, 
 Till all the dross of earthly loves 
 Is burned, and burned away. 
5 O light in darkness, joy in grief, 
 heaven’s life on earth; 
 Jesus, my love, my treasure, who 
 Can tell what Thou art worth? 
6 What limit is them to this love? 
 Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay? 
 On, on! our Lord is sweeter far 
 Today than yesterday.

351 从祂庄严荣耀高处降卑
1 从祂庄严荣耀高处降卑，  来此祸患之所； 
 亲自担当我罪除我羞愧，  何竟如此爱我？ 
和 我怎能不爱救主？ 
 祂这样爱我！ 
 我怎能不爱救主？ 
 祂这样爱我！ 
2 我真不配得祂奇妙恩惠，  白白恩典何多！ 
 受苦、受死，站在罪人地位，  竟为不堪如我！ 
3 千万人中，救主最为甜美，  祂爱真实稳妥； 
 我今看见主的美丽宝贵，  远超从前甚多。 
351 DOWN FROM HIS SPLENDOR IN GLORY HE  CAME
10.6.10.6. WITH CHORUS 
Loving the Lord 
1 Down from His splendor in glory He came, 
 Into a world of woe; 
 Took on Himself all my guilt and my shame, 
 Why should He should He love me so? 
(C) How can I help but love Him, 
 When He loved me so? 
 How can I help but love Him, 
 When He loved me so? 
2 I am unworthy to take of His grace, 
 Wonderful grace so free; 
 Yet Jesus suffered and died in my place, 
 E’en for a soul like me. 
3 He is the fairest of thousands to me, 
 His love is sweet and true; 
 Wonderful beauty in Him I now see, 
 More than I ever knew.
352 我爱我主但我无爱可给
1 我爱我主，但我无爱可给，  因无爱在我里； 
 主，我爱你，所有的爱属你，  我活在你爱里， 
 我一无所有，甘心来经历，  倒空、吞没、并消失在你里。 
2 哦！主，你是我们一切所需，  无人与你比拟， 
 祝福泉源从你涌流不息，  有福因住你里， 
 生命的活泉，丰盛的恩典，  你是我们中心、居所、泉源。 
352 I LOVE MY LORD BUT WITH NO LOVE OF  MINE
1 I love my Lord, but with no love of mine, 
 For I have none to give; 
 I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine, 
 For by Thy love I live. 
 I am as nothing, and rejoice to be 
 Emptied, and lost, and swallow’d up in Thee. 
2 Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need, 
 And there is none beside; 
 From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed, 
 In Thee the bless’d abide. 
 Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace, 
 Our source, our center, and our dwelling-place.
353 耶稣你的全胜的爱
1 耶稣，你的全胜的爱，  已经浇灌我心， 
 我心就不再会摇摆，  就能生根于神。 
 就能生根于神。 
2 但愿圣火今在我心，  就已发旺不休； 
 烧掉所有卑情下品，  并使高山镕流。 
 并使高山镕流。 
3 你曾赐下祭坛火炭，  求你烧掉我罪； 
 我向焚烧的灵呼喊，  圣灵满我心内。 
 圣灵满我心内。 
4 我心要接锻炼的火，  将我旧造烧绝； 
 散布生命在每角落，  并使全人圣洁。 
 并使全人圣洁。 
5 摇动的心求你扶掖，  使它变成坚崖； 
 基督成为我的世界，  我的全心成爱。 
 我的全心成爱。 
353 JESUS THINE ALL VICTORIOUS LOVE
1 Jesus Thine all victorious love 
 Shed in my soul abroad; 
 Then shall my heart no longer rove, 
 Rooted and fix’d in God. 
 Rooted and fix’d in God. 
2 Oh, that in me the sacred fire 
 Might now begin to glow; 
 Burn up the dross of base desire, 
 And make the mountains flow. 
 And make the mountains flow. 
3 Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall, 
 Do Thou my sins consume; 
 Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call; 
 Spirit of Burning, come! 
 Spirit of Burning, come! 
4 Refining fire, go through my heart, 
 Illuminate my soul; 
 Scatter Thy life through every part, 
 And sanctify the whole. 
 And sanctify the whole. 
5 My steadfast soul, from falling free, 
 Shall then no longer move, 
 While Christ is all the world to me, 
 And all my heart is love. 
 And all my heart is love.
354 恩主我爱你我深知你属我
1 恩主，我爱你，我深知你属我；  一切罪中乐，我为你全摆脱。  你是我救主，曾流血将我买；  如果我爱你，主耶稣，是现在！ 
2 恩主，我爱你，因为你先爱我，  为我在加略将赎价已付妥。  爱你，是因为荆棘冕你肯戴；  如果我爱你，主耶稣，是现在！ 
3 活着我爱你，就是死也爱你；  并要赞美你，只要你给气息。  即是死临到，我仍然要表白：  如果我爱你，主耶稣，是现在！ 
4 在那无止境喜乐的荣耀里，  我要在光中到永远敬拜你；  头戴荣耀冕，我还要唱出来；  如果我爱你，主耶稣，是现在！ 
354 LORD JESUS I LOVE THEE I KNOW THOU  ART MINE
1 Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine; 
 For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign; 
 My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou, 
 If ever I lov’d Thee, Lord Jesus, ‘tis now. 
2 I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me, 
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree; 
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow; 
 If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ‘tis now. 
3 I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death, 
 And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;  And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,  If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ‘tis now. 
4 In ages eternal of endless delight 
 I’ll ever adore Thee in glory so bright; 
 I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow, 
 If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ‘tis now.
355 主耶稣我们爱你
1 主耶稣，我们爱你； 
 我们的最爱是你。 
 当我们心在爱你， 
 就满了甜美、安息！ 
 主，我们爱你自己， 
 非爱你所给、所作。 
 无何能与你比拟， 
 爱你叫我心快活。 
和 主，我们曾被许多事物吸引，  今将此心转回归你； 
 我们懊悔爱别的事物，  主耶稣，我们爱你。 
 (回头再唱正歌一遍)  
2 你以外别无事物， 
 能满足我们心愿， 
 愿我们心里渴慕 -  
 单单被你来充满。 
 主耶稣，我们爱你； 
 我们的最爱是你。 
 当我们心在爱你， 
 就满了甜美、安息！ 
 (第二节不唱”和”歌)  
355 JESUS LORD YOU’RE OUR FIRST LOVE
1 Jesus, Lord, you’re our first love; 
 You’re the One we love the best. 
 When our heart is loving You, 
 How we’re filled with Your sweet rest! 
 Lord, we love You for Yourself, 
 Not for what You give or do. 
 Nothing else could e’er compare 
 With the joy of loving You. 
(C) Lord, we’ve been drawn off by many things;  Now we turn our heart back — how it sings!  We repent of loving other things —  
 Jesus, Lord, You’re our first love. 
 (Repeat the first eight lines) 
2 Never more could we desire 
 Anything that’s less than You, 
 And to this we will aspire —  
 Simply to be filled with You. 
 Jesus, Lord, You’re our first love; 
 You’re the One we love the best. 
 When our bean is loving You, 
 How we’re filled with Your sweet rest! 
 (Do not repeat chorus)
356 有一个名我爱听见
1 有一个名我爱听见，  我爱唱它价值；
 犹如音乐美妙甘甜，  地上无名如此。 
和 我何等爱耶稣， 
 我何等爱耶稣， 
 我何等爱耶稣， 
 因为祂先爱我。 
2 这名说出救主的爱，  祂死使我自由； 
 祂的宝血已流出来，  神前为我代求。 
3 这名说出我父为我，  每日所有预备； 
 我今虽在暗中摸索，  终必布满光辉！ 
4 这名说出祂心有爱，  知我深处愁苦； 
 每一忧伤祂都担代，  地上无人同负。 
356 THERE IS A NAME I LOVE TO HEAR
1 There is a name I love to hear, 
 I love to sing its worth; 
 It sounds like music in mine ear, 
 The sweetest name on earth. 
(C) Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me! 
2 It tells me of a Savior’s love, 
 Who died to set me free; 
 It tells me of His precious blood, 
 The sinner’s perfect plea. 
3 It tells me what my Father hath, 
 In store for every day, 
 And tho’ I tread a darksome path, 
 Yields sunshine all the way. 
4 It tells of One whose loving heart 
 Can feel my deepest woe, 
 Who in each sorrow bears a part, 
 That none can bear below.
357 谁能像我耶稣我全心爱慕
1 谁能像我耶稣？我全心爱慕！  祂的爱吸引我，将我灵烧着！  我不能不爱祂，要宣告这话：  “主耶稣，我爱你，将你名高举！”  
2 我的生命、供给，惟你是安息：  你名是我题目，我爱的歌赋；  你爱感动我心，使我口诵吟。
3 犹如每晨破晓，阴影都窜逃。
4 我爱你，我爱你，哦主，我爱你。  主耶稣，我爱你，我神，我爱你！  我爱你，我爱你，你知我情意；  你同在的面光，使我爱增长。 
357 OH WHO’S LIKE OUR JESUS HE’S ALL WE  DESIRE
1 Oh, who’s like our Jesus? He’s all we desire! 
 His love draws us near sets our spirits afire! 
 We cannot but love Him As one we proclaim: “Lord  Jesus, we love Thee exalt Thy dear name!” 
2 O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest —  
 Our Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest:  Thy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song;  Thy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue! 
3 O Jesus, our Jesus, how can we express 
 Thy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness? 
 When we see Thy beauty, all else fades away —  
 All shadows must flee at the breaking of day! 
4 We love Thee, we love Thee, we love Thee, O Lord.  We love Thee, our Jesus, we love Thee, our God! 
 We love Thee, we love Thee, and that Thou dost know;  As we’re in Thy presence, love for Thee will grow!

358 愿我爱你更深
1 愿我爱你更深！ 
 爱你更深！ 
 哦主，听此求恳，  成全此心。 
 我心真是切慕： 
 爱你更深，我主，  爱你更深，爱你更深！ 
2 前我追求世福、 
 贪享安乐， 
 今只寻求基督， 
 解我干渴； 
 我今惟独切慕： 
 爱你更深，我主，  爱你更深，爱你更深！ 
3 差遣痛苦、伤悲，  将我试炼； 
 主，你使者何美！  其歌何甜！ 
 我同它们唱出： 
 爱你更深，我主，  爱你更深，爱你更深！ 
4 直到呼吸渐促， 
 歌声渐收， 
 我心仍要发出 
 临别节奏， 
 且要永远渴慕： 
 爱你更深，我主，  爱你更深，爱你更深！ 
358 MORE LOVE TO THEE O CHRIST
1 More love to Thee, O Christ, 
 More love to Thee! 
 Hear Thou the prayer I make 
 On bended knee; 
 This is my earnest plea: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, More love to Thee. 
2 Once earthly joy I craved, 
 Sought peace and rest; 
 Now Thee alone I seek, 
 Give what is best; 
 This all my prayer shall be: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, More love to Thee! 
3 Let sorrow do its work, 
 Send grief and pain; 
 Sweet are Thy messengers, 
 Sweet their refrain, 
 When they can sing with me: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, More love to Thee! 
4 Then shall my latest breath 
 Whisper Thy praise; 
 This be the parting cry 
 My heart shall raise; 
 This still its prayer shall be: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

359 我在此时刻要欢唱诗歌 特.
 1 我在此时刻，要欢唱诗歌，  向主唱一首爱的诗歌。  我在此时刻，要高举双手，  向我的主高举双手。  高唱我爱你，主；
 高唱我爱你，主； 
 高唱我爱你， 
 主，我爱你。 
359 IN MOMENTS LIKE THESE I SING OUT A  SONG
1 IRREGULAR METER
Loving the Lord 
 In moments like these I sing out a song, 
 I sing out a love song to Jesus. 
 In moments like these I lift up my hands, 
 I lift up my hands to the Lord. 
 Singing I love You, Lord, 
 Singing I love You, Lord, 
 Singing I love You, Lord, 
 I love You, Lord.
360 如鹿切慕溪水的心怀
1 如鹿切慕溪水的心怀，  哦神，我切慕要你。  惟有你是我的心所爱，  我渴慕来敬拜你。 
和 你是我的力量、盾牌，  我的灵单单降服于你。  惟有你是我心所爱，  我渴慕来敬拜你。 
2 主，你是我友，我的弟兄，  虽然你也是君王。 
 我的心爱你，为你心倾，  胜过其他的对象。 
3 宁舍金银，为将你得着，  惟有你满足我心。 
 惟有你能赐真实喜乐，  是我眼中的瞳人。 
360 AS THE DEER PANTETH FOR THE WATER
1 As the deer panteth for the water, 
 So my soul longeth after Thee. 
 You alone are my heart’s desire, 
 And I long to worship Thee. 
(C) You alone are my strength, my shield; 
 To You alone may my spirit yield. 
 You alone are my heart’s desire 
 And I long to worship Thee. 
2 You’re my friend and You are my brother 
 Even though You are a King. 
 I love You more than any other, 
 So much more than anything. 
3 I want You more than gold or silver, 
 Only You can satisfy. 
 You alone are the real joy giver 
 And the apple of my eye.
361 我如困鹿切慕溪水
1 我如困鹿切慕溪水，  里面干渴难言； 
 哦神，我心惟你是追，  并你复苏恩典。 
2 我的心哪，为何忧闷？  应当信靠我神； 
 祂必使你叹息之声，  变为赞美、颂称。 
3 活的神哪，你是我神，  我心饥渴要你； 
 深愿我能亲近你身，  面见你的自己。 
4 神是我的生命、力量，  何觉孤苦伶仃？ 
 祂从未曾将我遗忘，  任令仇敌欺凌。 
5 我的心哪，为何忧闷？  祂是你的盼望； 
 故当歌唱、赞美你神，  因祂活泉欢畅。 
361 AS PANTS THE HART FOR COOLING  STREAMS
1 As pants the hart for cooling streams 
 When heated in the chase, 
 So longs my soul, O God, for Thee, 
 And Thy refreshing grace. 
2 Why restless, why cast down, my soul? 
 Trust God, who will employ 
 His aid for thee, and change these sighs 
 To thankful hymns of joy. 
3 For Thee, my God, the living God, 
 My thirsty soul doth pine; 
 Oh, when shall I behold Thy face, 
 Thou Majesty Divine? 
4 God of my strength, how long shall I, 
 Like one forgotten, mourn, 
 Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed 
 To my oppressor’s scorn? 
5 Why restless, why cast down, my soul? 
 Hope still, and thou shalt sing 
 The praise of Him who is thy God, 
 Thy health’s eternal spring.
362 我心所追求乃是神自己
1 我心所追求，乃是神自己，  不是乐与安，也不是福气；  我能出代价，达到这圣地，  不是我自己，乃是祂恩力。 
2 因信而向前，要得神自己，  凭爱而跟随，永远不他依；  因祂扶持我，我追随不已，  直到神答应，我最深祷祈。 
3 虽然这道路，有时真可怕，  虽然这代价，常是非常大，  但是神知道，何者是我需，  得着神的路，永不能弯曲。 
4 一事我所知，祂永不会错，  一事我所作，要将祂得着；  一天过一天，神是我所要，  至终的赏赐，神作我荣耀。 
362 MY GOAL IS GOD HIM SELF NOT JOY NOR  PEACE
1 My goal is God Him self, not joy, nor peace, 
 Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God; 
 ‘Tis His to lead me there not mine, but His 
 At any cost, dear Lord, by any road. 
2 So faith bounds forward to its goal in God, 
 And love can trust her Lord to lead her there; 
 Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard 
 Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer. 
3 No matter if the way be sometimes dark, 
 No matter though the cost be oft-times great, 
 He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark, 
 The way that leads to Him must needs be strait. 
4 One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay; 
 One thing I do, I press towards my Lord; 
 My God my glory here, from day to day, 
 And in the glory there my great Reward.
363 我今承认我真需要耶稣
1 我今承认，我真需要耶稣；  在苦闷时，无一朋友像主；  我心欢乐，因我已得耶稣；  别人仍背自己重担， 
 但我要耶稣。 
和 需要耶稣，需要耶稣，  我每日需要耶稣； 
 光明时刻我要主， 
 黑云密布我要主， 
 天天与我同行路， 
 我需要耶稣。 
2 需要耶稣，我需一友像祂；  前途昏暗，祂来引领眷顾；  需要耶稣，当我遭敌击打；  我知自己难免失败， 
 我需要耶稣。 
3 需要耶稣，需祂直到辞世；  罪人之友，从无一人像主；  需要耶稣，别无他友如此  持久、亲切、坚强、真实，  我需要耶稣。 
363 I NEED JESUS MY NEED I NOW CONFESS
1 I need Jesus, my need I now confess; 
 No friend like Him in times of deep distress; 
 I need Jesus, the need I gladly own; 
 Tho’ some may bear their load alone, 
 Yet I need Jesus. 
(C) I need Jesus, I need Jesus, 
 I need Jesus ev’ry day; 
 Need Him in the sunshine hour, 
 Need Him when the storm-clouds low’r; 
 Every day a long my way, 
 Yes, I need Jesus. 
2 I need Jesus, I need a friend like Him, 
 A friend to guide when paths of life are dim; 
 I need Jesus, when foes my soul assail; 
 Alone I know I can but fail, 
 So I need Jesus. 
3 I need Jesus, I need Him to the end; 
 No one like Him, He is the sinner’s friend; 
 I need Jesus, no other friend will do; 
 So constant, kind, so strong and tree, 
 Yes, I need Jesus.
364 哦主你是人心之乐
1 哦主，你是人心之乐，  生命之源，人们之光，  从地所给最佳福乐，  空心转来向你仰望。 
2 你的真实永存不变，  凡求你者，你都提挈：  对寻求者，你是良善，  对寻得者，你是一切。 
3 生命的粮，我已尝过，  仍是切慕尝食不已；  活水的泉，我饮虽多，  仍是渴望更多饮你。 
4 当那易变之福改变，  不安的灵对你渴慕；  欢喜，因见你的笑脸，  有福，凭信将你抓住。 
5 愿你作我力量、维持！  使我时时宁静、明亮，  驱尽黑暗罪恶之思，  向我倒下你的圣光。 
364 JESUS THOU JOY OF LOVING HEARTS
1 Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts, 
 Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men, 
 From the best bliss that earth imparts, 
 We turn unfilled to Thee again. 
2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; 
 Thou savest those that on Thee call; 
 To them that seek Thee, Thou art good, 
 To them that find Thee, all in all! 
3 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread, 
 And long to feast upon Thee still; 
 We drink of Thee, the Fountain-head, 
 And thirst our souls from Thee to fill! 
4 Our restless spirits yearn for Thee, 
 Where’er our changeful lot is cast; 
 Glad when Thy gracious smile we see 
 Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast. 
5 O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay! 
 Make all our moments calm and bright, 
 Chase all dark thoughts of sin away, 
 Shed o’er us here Thy holy light.
365 神圣之爱远超众爱
1 神圣之爱，远超众爱，  天上之乐临地上，
 竟来住我卑微胸怀，  作我相信的恩赏。 
 恩主，你是所有怜悯，  你是纯洁无限爱； 
 眷顾我们，带来救恩，  进入相信的胸怀。 
2 哦主，向我吹你圣灵，  吹进烦扰的心里； 
 使我有分你的丰盛，  享受应许的安息。 
 从我除去罪的爱好，  除去一切的捆绑； 
 使我认识生命之道，  使我完全得释放。 
3 大能的主，前来拯救，  赐我生命何丰盛； 
 愿你同在直到永久，  永远住在你殿中。 
 我要时常颂赞你名，  照你喜悦事奉你， 
 不住祷告，不住颂称，  夸耀你爱永无已。 
4 求你完成你的新造，  使我纯洁无瑕疵； 
 你大救恩我全享到，  得以和你全相似； 
 更新变化，荣上加荣，  直到满有你身量， 
 直到进入荣耀之中，  永远将你爱颂扬。 
365 LOVE DIVINE ALL LOVE EXCELLING
1 Love Divine, all love excelling, 
 Joy of heav’n, to earth come down; 
 Fix in us Thy humble dwelling, 
 All Thy faithful mercies crown. 
 Jesus, Thou art all compassion; 
 Pure, unbounded love Thou art; 
 Visit us with Thy salvation, 
 Enter every trembling heart. 
2 Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit 
 Into every troubled breast; 
 Let us all in Thee inherit, 
 Let us find the promised rest. 
 Take away the love of sinning; 
 Alpha and Omega be; 
 End of faith, as its beginning, 
 Set our hearts at liberty. 
3 Come, Almighty, to deliver, 
 Let us all Thy life receive; 
 May Thy presence e’er be with us, 
 Never more Thy temples leave. 
 Thee we would be always blessing, 
 Serve Thee as Thou wouldst approve, 
 Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing, 
 Glory in Thy perfect love. 
4 Finish, then, Thy new creation; 
 Pure and spotless let us be; 
 Let us see Thy great salvation 
 Perfectly restored in Thee; 
 Changed from glory into glory 
 Till with Thee we take our place, 
 Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
 Lost in wonder, love and praise.

1 祂为我死，我才能活；  我今为祂活着，
 我命、我爱，我都献给  那为我钉死的。 
和 哦，耶稣我主，我救主！  使我能专心跟从主；  你怎样为我而死而活，  让我照样为你死活。 
2 祂为我死，我才能死，  脱离罪、己、俗世。  死何深奥！生何高超！  愿我联合、倚靠！ 
3 祂为我活，我才能活，  像祂那样”无我；”  
 求主从我显你性情，  活出你的生命。 
4 祂为我活，我愿一生  把祂分给众人； 
 让我像主为人而活，  跟随主的领率。 
367 HE DIED FOR ME THAT I MIGHT LIVE
1 He died for me that I might live; 
 I live for Him who died, 
 My life, my love to Him I give —  
 Jesus, the Crucified. 
(C) O Jesus, my Lord and Savior, 
 Help me to fully follow Thee 
 In life and death and loving service, 
 As Thou hast lived and died for me. 
2 He died for me that I might die 
 To Satan, self, and sin; 
 O death so deep! O life so high! 
 Help me to enter in. 
3 He lives for me that I may live 
 As spotless e’en as He; 
 Savior, to me Thy nature give, 
 And live Thy life in me. 
4 He lives for me that I may give 
 His love to hearts that pine; 
 Let me like Him for others live, 
 And trace His steps divine.
368 愿你为大哦主耶稣
1 愿你为大，哦主耶稣！  信条、话语、虚仪、  属人的会、属世的爱，  不能与你相比。 
2 愿你为大，哦主耶稣！  你爱征服了我； 
 靠你十架我向己死，  完全为你而活。 
3 愿你为大，哦主耶稣！  全人被你充满， 
 使我思想像你思想，  喜欢像你喜欢。 
4 愿你为大，哦主耶稣！  把我改变全备； 
 从这幔子(软弱肉体)   显出你的荣美。 
5 愿你为大，哦主耶稣！  我心真是要求： 
 作你奴仆，行你旨意，  一生不再自由。 
368 BE THOU SUPREME O JESUS CHRIST
1 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 Nor creed, nor form, nor word, 
 Nor holy Church, nor human love, 
 Compare with Thee, my Lord! 
2 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 Thy love has conquered me; 
 Beneath Thy Cross I die to self, 
 And live alone to Thee. 
3 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 My inmost being fill; 
 So shall I think as Thou dost think, 
 And will as Thou dost will. 
4 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 Thy life transfigure mine; 
 And through this veil of mortal flesh, 
 Lord, let Thy splendor shine. 
5 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 My soul exults in Thee; 
 To be Thy slave, to do Thy will, 
 Is my felicity.
369 与我同住夕阳西沉迅速
1 与我同住，夕阳西沉迅速；  黑暗渐深，求主与我同住；  安慰消逝，且无何人能助；  无助之助，求你与我同住。 
2 人生短日，转瞬就已入暮，  地乐灯残，世荣花谢草枯；  四境所见，尽是变迁朽腐；  永不变者，求来与我同住。 
3 莫带威严，有如王中之王，  只带慈良，并你施医翅膀，  泪来洗忧，心来听我求诉；  罪人之友，请来与我同住。 
4 你的同在，时时我都需要；  除你恩典，何能使魔败逃；  有谁像你，将我引导扶助；  或阴或晴，求你与我同住。 
5 有你赐福，我就不怕敌凶；  病而不苦，流泪也不酸痛；  什么毒钩！什么死亡、坟墓！  我都胜过，若你与我同住。 
369 ABIDE WITH ME FAST FALLS THE  EVENTIDE
1 Abide with me! fast falls the eventide; 
 The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!  When other helpers fail and comforts flee,  Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me. 
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;  Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;  Change and decay in all around I see; 
 O Thou who changest not, abide with me. 
3 Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;  But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:  Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;  Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me. 
4 I need Thy presence every passing hour: 
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?  Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me. 
5 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless: 
 Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:  Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?  I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
370 我心与我救主毫无间隔
1 我心与我救主毫无间隔，  今世幻梦不再能阻隔；  我已撇弃一切罪中之乐，  基督属我，与祂无间隔。 
和 我心与我救主毫无间隔，  以祂笑脸为我的喜乐；  无事能拦阻祂所赐的恩泽，  因我与主保持无间隔。 
2 没有间隔，撇下世俗之乐；  生活习惯虽似无可责，  但不能使我心和祂分割；  祂是一切，与主无间隔。 
3 没有间隔，骄傲、地位已舍；  “己”和友情不再能阻隔，  虽受痛苦，仍要与主联合；  我已定意，与主无间隔。 
4 没有间隔，试炼虽极艰苦，  举世阻我来与主相合，  儆醒祷告，并走舍己之路，  终必得胜，与主无间隔。 
370 NOTHING BETWEEN MY SOUL AND THE  SAVIOR
10.9.10.9. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Nothing between my soul and the Savior, 
 Naught of this world’s delusive dream; 
 I have renounced all sinful pleasure; 
 Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between. 
(C) Nothing between my soul and the Savior, 
 So that His blessed face may be seen; 
 Nothing preventing the least of His favor, 
 Keep the way clear! Let nothing between. 
2 Nothing between, like worldly pleasure; 
 Habits of life, though harmless they seem, 
 Must not my heart from Him e’er sever; 
 He is my all, there’s nothing between. 
3 Nothing between, like pride or station; 
 Self-life or friends shall not intervene; 
 Though it may cost me much tribulation, 
 I am resolved; there’s nothing between. 
4 Nothing between, e’en many hard trials, 
 Though the whole world against me convene; 
 Watching with prayer and much self-denial, 
 I’ll triumph at last, with nothing between.

371 我每时刻需你

 永偕无阻。 
371 I NEED THEE EVERY HOUR
1 I need Thee every hour, 
 Most gracious Lord; 
 No tender voice like Thine 
 Can peace afford. 
(C) I need Thee, oh, I need Thee; 
 Every hour I need Thee; 
 Oh, bless me now, my Savior!  I come to Thee. 
2 I need Thee every hour, 
 Stay Thou near by; 
 Temptations lose their power 
 When Thou art nigh. 
3 I need Thee every hour, 
 In joy or pain; 
 Come quickly and abide, 
 Or life is vain. 
4 I need Thee every hour, 
 Teach me Thy will; 
 And Thy rich promises 
 In me fulfill. 
5 I need Thee every hour, 
 Most Holy One; 
 Oh, make me’ Thine indeed, 
 Thou blessed Son.

372 主阿求你来充满我
1 主阿，求你来充满我，  赞美洋溢各部， 
 使我全人能够传播  你所是和道路。 
2 不仅是嘴唇的称祝，  或仅心中感铭， 
 乃是全人内里各部  都由赞美组成。 
3 日常生活所遭事物，  虽或微小、平凡，  每一作为，虽不特出，  仍能赞美不断。 
4 求用赞美满我各部，  我虽又贫又弱， 
 仍能用我全人说出  你和你爱所作。 
5 无论昼夜不分时刻，  完全分别为圣， 
 愿我一生每一时刻，  与你交通更深。 
372 FILL THOU MY LIFE O LORD MY GOD
1 Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God, 
 In ev ‘ry part with praise, 
 That my whole being may proclaim 
 Thy being and Thy ways. 
2 Not for the lip of praise alone, 
 Nor e’en the praising heart, 
 I ask, but for a life made up 
 Of praise in every part: 
3 Fill every part of me with praise; 
 Let all my being speak 
 Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord, 
 Poor though I be and weak. 
4 Praise in the common things of life, 
 Its goings out and in; 
 Praise in each duty and each deed, 
 However small and mean. 
5 So shall no part of day or night 
 From sacredness be free, 
 But all my life, in every step, 
 Be fellowship with Thee.
373 没有间隔主没有间隔 特.
1 没有间隔，主，没有间隔；  让我见你荣面， 
 引我近你身边， 
 然后听你慈言；

 不乱你的微声；

 没有属己兴趣， 
 没有掩饰空虚； 
 没有间隔，没有间隔。 
4 没有间隔，主，没有间隔；  当你亲近我时， 
 疑惑完全消失， 
 恐惧也都停止； 
 没有间隔，没有间隔。 
5 没有间隔，主，没有间隔；  求你照耀辉煌， 
 消灭一切邪光， 
 作我无限心王； 
 没有间隔，没有间隔。 
6 没有间隔，主，没有间隔；  愿我如此随你， 
 愿我所见惟你， 
 愿我所归惟你； 
 没有间隔，没有间隔。 
7 没有间隔，主，没有间隔；  直到我眼看见 
 你的永光显现， 
 驱尽属地黑暗； 
 没有间隔，没有间隔。

1 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Let me Thy glory see, 
 Draw my soul close to Thee, 
 Then speak in love to me —  
 Nothing between. 
2 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Let not earth’s din and noise 
 Stifle Thy still small voice; 
 In it let me rejoice —  
 Nothing between. 
3 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Nothing of earthly care, 
 Nothing of tear or prayer, 
 No robe that self may wear —  
 Nothing between. 
4 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Unbelief disappear, 
 Vanish each doubt and fear, 
 Fading when Thou art near —  
 Nothing between. 
5 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Shine with unclouded ray, 
 Chasing each mist away, 
 O’er my whole heart bear sway —  
 Nothing between. 
6 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Thus may I walk with Thee, 
 Thee only may I see, 
 Thine only let me be —

374 我心饥渴疲乏
1 我心饥渴、疲乏，  主，你是我吗哪，  又是活水流自 
 为我裂开磐石。 
2 你这擘开之饼，  是我一生供应；  全人得你喂养，  主，喂我，否则亡。 
3 你是真葡萄树，  因你甘甜满足；  愿你将我更新，  大爱满溢我心。 
4 今仍行在野地，  我魂干渴不已；  你这活水泉源，  涌流在我里面。 
374 I HUNGER AND I THIRST
1 I hunger and I thirst; 
 Jesus, my manna be; 
 Ye living waters, burst 
 Out of the rock for me. 
2 Thou bruised and broken Bread,  My lifelong wants supply; 
 As living souls are fed, 
 O feed me, or I die. 
3 Thou true life-giving Vine, 
 Let me Thy sweetness prove; 
 Renew my life with Thine, 
 Refresh my soul with love. 
4 For still the desert lies 
 My thirsting soul before; 
 O living waters, rise 
 Within me evermore.

375 求主带我上到高山
1 求主带我上到高山，  给我只见你自己，  天上声音给我听见，  新鲜空气给我吸。
和 带我上到更高之山，  与你交通更亲密；  更在灵中饮于活泉，  更得享受你自己。 
2 更高山上，更高亮光，  远超属地的管辖；  生命之中与你同王，  脱离徒劳的挣扎。 
3 保守我在更高山上，  向着标竿直往前；  直到模成你的形像，  流露你爱和恩典。 
375 SAVIOR LEAD ME UP THE MOUNTAIN
1 Savior, lead me up the mountain, 
 Where the Lord alone is seen, 
 Where we hear the voice from heaven, 
 Where the air is pure and clean. 
(C) Lead me higher up the mountain, 
 Give me fellowship with Thee; 
 In Thy light I see the fountain, 
 And the blood it cleanses me. 
2 Higher up where light increases, 
 Far above all earthly strife, 
 Where the strain of effort ceases, 
 Where in Christ we reign in Life. 
3 Savior, keep me up the mountain 
 Pressing on toward the goal, 
 Till, as one, we share Thine image, 
 And Thy love and grace extol.
376 天程旅客的粮食
1 天程旅客的粮食，  圣徒可食之饼，  每日吗哪天所赐，  适合属天性情；  长久渴慕享受你，  饱尝你的丰富，  直到地乐全灭迹，  所有心愿满足。
2 涌流生命的活水，  流自裂开灵磐，  明晶活泉何甘美，  你是爱的泉源。  让我白白来畅饮，  消除我的干渴；  你外，别水不再寻，  永远将你来喝。 
3 在此欢然享受你，  我们向你拜礼；  相信你信实话语，  接受不再怀疑。  使我从你得喂养，  凭你活在地上；  除去帕子的遮藏，  得见你的面光。 
376 O BREAD TO PILGRIMS GIVEN
1 O Bread to pilgrims given, 
 O Food for saints to eat, 
 O Manna sent from heaven, 
 For heav’n-born natures meet; 
 Give us, for Thee long pining, 
 To eat till richly filled; 
 Till, earth’s delights resigning, 
 Our ev’ry wish is stilled. 
2 O Water, life bestowing, 
 From out the Savior’s heart, 
 A fountain purely flowing, 
 A fount of love Thou art. 
 Oh, let us, freely tasting, 
 Our burning thirst assuage; 
 Thy sweetness, never wasting, 
 Avails from age to age. 
3 Jesus, this feast receiving, 
 We Thee unseen adore; 
 Thy faithful word believing, 
 We take, and doubt no more. 
 Give us, Thou tree and loving, 
 On earth to live in Thee; 
 Then, God the veil removing, 
 Thy glorious face to see.
377 哦父神照你心意
1 哦，父神，照你心意，  将你爱子形像 
 启示在我们心里，  使祂活活显彰。 
 祂是神成为肉身，  祂是神的显出； 
 丰满、奥妙三一神，  藉祂完全得睹。 
2 我们心思被蒙蔽，  长久在黑暗里， 
 现今盼望脱己意，  好将帕子揭起。 
 神的荣光时照耀，  圣经满有亮光； 
 可惜我们被罩着，  烈烈光辉难望。 
3 捆绑这世代的神！  主，此心转向你；  从前我们心所珍，  不再向它拜礼。 
 主，我们全心归你，  因被你恩俘虏。 
 将异象充满心里，  里外荣光满布！ 
4 赐下宝贵话语！
 满有启示在话里，  引人与主相遇。 
 逐节将你话祷告，  同众圣徒追求， 
 必得着启示、引导，  将你荣耀观透。 
5 我们藉完全顺服，  将此心转向主， 
 心思在灵上关注，  将祂的话虔读， 
 神就必乐意启示  祂儿子在心里， 
 使我们完全认识  祂的爱子无遗。 
377 O GOD WE SEEK YOUR PLEASURE
1 O God, we seek Your pleasure, 
 A vision of the Son, 
 Of that real living Person, 
 Your dear beloved One! 
 For He is God embodied, 
 And He is God expressed; 
 The Triune God in fullness 
 In Him is manifest. 
2 Now we would leave our own thoughts,  The veils upon our mind, 
 Removing all the layers 
 Which long have kept us blind. 
 Our God is always shining, 
 The Bible’s full of light, 
 But we’ve been thickly covered 
 From radiancy so bright. 
3 Lord, bind the god of this age! 
 We turn our hearts to You. 
 None other do we worship; 
 With all beside we’re through. 
 We’ve only hearts for You, Lord; 
 Your grace has captured us. 
 Oh, fill our hearts with vision, 
 Inward, yet glorious. 
4 O Father, how we praise You —  
 We have Your precious Word! 
 So full of revelation 
 That we may see the Lord. 
 May we pray o’er the verses 
 And with the saints pursue, 
 Then get a revelation, 
 And all Your glory view. 
5 ‘Tis by our full obedience, 
 Our heart turned to the Lord, 
 Our mind set on the spirit 
 And praying o’er His Word, 
 That God gives in His pleasure 
 A vision of His Son, 
 Revealing Him within us, 
 His dear beloved One.
378 愿所见惟你主我祈求
1 愿所见惟你，主，我祈求，  使我的心眼被你占有；  虽行经幽谷，有你引领，  并以你荣耀环绕不稍停。 
和 愿所见惟你，亲爱救主，  直到你荣耀从我灵照出；  愿所见惟你，使人共睹  你圣洁形像从我里映出。 
2 愿所见惟你，使每欲求，  皆为主荣耀，而蒙保守；  愿你的完全，圣洁的爱，  光照我路径，激励我心怀。 
3 愿所见惟你，使无罪影  遮蔽里面那辉煌光明。  使我只见你可颂面容，  我魂常饱享你无限恩中。 
378 FILL ALL MY VISION SAVIOR I PRAY
1 Fill all my vision, Savior, I pray, 
 Let me see only Jesus today; 
 Tho’ through the valley Thou leadest me, 
 Thy fadeless glory encompasseth me. 
(C) Fill all my vision, Savior divine, 
 Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine. 
 Fill all my vision, that all may see 
 Thy Holy Image reflected in me.

 Keep for Thy glory; my soul inspire

379 O FATHER OF GLORIFY NOW GRANT UNTO  ME
1 O Father of glorify, now grant unto me 
 A spirit of wisdom, a spirit to see; 
 O give unto me the full knowledge of Him, 
 Enlightn’ing the eyes of my heart deep within. 
2 O show me that Christ is the hope of Thy call —  
 O glorious hope, Christ will fill all in all! 
 Reveal Him — the riches of glory in us —  
 As God’s own inheritance. How glorious! 
3 O God of our Lord Jesus, let me perceive 
 Th’ exceeding great pow’r unto us who believe, 
 The power that raised Christ, Thy Son, from the dead  And made Him o’er all, to His Body, the Head. 
4 O God, Thou hast wrought all this pow’r into Christ,  Who now lives in me as my Person, my life. 
 O grant revelation, dear Father, to see 
 This transcending pow’r is a Person in me. 
5 O Christ is the hope, He’s the glory and power; 
 So Christ I must take as my Person each hour. 
 Then in me such power will be exercised, 
 My hope and God’s glory will be realized.

 Who gave His Son my soul to save  And fit it for the sky. 
2 To serve the present age, 
 My calling to fulfill —  
 O may it all my pow’rs engage 
 To do my Master’s will! 
3 Arm me with jealous care, 
 As in Thy sight to live; 
 And O Thy servant, Lord, prepare  A strict account to give! 
4 Help me to watch and pray, 
 And on Thyself rely; 
 And let me ne’er my trust betray,  But press to realms on high.

2 我心一旦尝着你爱，  永不再被地乐充满；  无一事物是我心爱，  直到与你掌权在天。  那时我要注视你面，  将你恩典认识更全。 
3 从你高天荣耀宝座，  你看见我失败、堕落，  你来受死乃是为我，  使我与你同登宝座。  用你永远的爱爱我，  是我盼望、喜乐所托。 
4 哦，这地能给我什么？  我已蒙召享神喜乐；  向世已死，你里我活，  天天享受无上恩泽。  我的快乐不再属地；  万事属我，我是属你！ 
5 直到你来领我回家，  主，有一事我仍追求：  罪、己、世界，全钉十架，  将你可信的话持守；  天天更多识你自己，  直到我能完全像你。 
381 LORD JESUS THOU WHO ONLY ART
1 Lord Jesus, Thou who only art 
 The endless source of purest joy, 
 O come and fill this longing heart; 
 May nought but Thee my tho’ts employ. 
 Teach me on Thee to fix my eye, 
 For none but Thee can satisfy. 
2 The joys of earth can never fill 
 The heart that’s tasted of Thy love; 
 No portion would I seek until 
 I reign with Thee, my Lord, above, 
 When I shall gaze upon Thy face, 
 And know more fully all Thy grace, 
3 When from Thy radiant throne on high 
 Thou didst my fall and ruin see, 
 Thou cam’st on earth for me to die, 
 That I might share that throne with Thee. 
 Loved with an everlasting love, 
 My hopes, my joys are all above. 
4 O, what is all that earth can give? 
 I’m called to share in God’s own joy; 
 Dead to the world, in Thee I live, 
 In Thee I’ve bliss without alloy: 
 Well may I earthly joys resign; 
 All things are mine, and I am Thine! 
5 Till Thou shalt come to take me home, 
 Be this my one ambition, Lord, 
 Self, sin, the world, to overcome, 
 Fast clinging to Thy faithful word; 
 More of Thyself each day to know, 
 And more into Thine image grow.

3 更多得着圣灵启示，  更多知道神的意思；  更多看见幔内的事，  更多效法基督的死。 
4 更多相信主的圣言，  更多倚靠祂的恩典；  更多爱慕祂的显现，  更多盼望祂的王权。

 Hearing His voice in every line, 
 Making each faithful saying mine. 
4 More about Jesus; on His throne, 
 Riches in glory all His own; 
 More of His kingdom’s sure increase; 
 More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
383 主耶稣我羡慕活在你面前
1 主耶稣，我羡慕活在你面前，  在早晨，在晚上，只有一世间；  不让我心快乐，若我在爱慕、  在感觉、或思想无你的事物。  每一刻，每一天，不论何痛苦，  当世上正没有什么可鼓舞，  当叹息正不禁，眼泪流滴滴，  主，擦干我眼泪，平静我叹息。 
2 我每次如梦想人生的善美，  亲爱主，我求你，必须也在内！  不让我离开你去寻求快乐，  不让我凭自己去单独选择！  当每夜万籁静，孤单自处时，  主耶稣，我求你，仍与我同止；  当每晨未破晓，我仍蒙昧中，  求你来低声唤，将我耳开通。 
3 当每次我虔读你圣洁话语，  求你用你荣耀照亮每一句；  让我能明看见：这宝贵救主，  和祂的大救恩，无一不我属。  当我正无倚靠跪到你座前，  求垂听我祷告，赐够用恩典；  有时候因有错，祷告你不听，  别收回你同在，使我感不宁。 
4 当每次我想到属天的福气，  让我心切羡慕早日会见你；  我在此所希望只有你再来，  我在彼所快乐只有你同在。  主，求你教训我活在你面前， 
 在早晨，在晚上，只有一世间；  不让我心快乐，若我在爱慕、  在感觉、或思想无你的事物。 
383 LORD JESUS I LONG IN THY PRESENCE TO  LIVE
1 Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live, 
 From morning to evening my one world Thou art; 
 O let not my heart be contented or rest 
 When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part. 
 Each moment, each day, throughout suff’ring and pain,  When nought in the world can give comfort or cheer,  When sighing and weeping encompasses me, 
 Lord, still all my sighing and wipe ev’ry tear. 
2 Each time when I dream of the goodness of life, 
 I pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be; 
 O do not allow me to choose by myself, 
 Or seek any pleasure that’s other than Thee. 
 Each night when alone in the stillness I lie, 
 I pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near; 
 Each morning ere dawn comes, while still in my sleep,  Then whispering call me and open my ear. 
3 Each time, Lord, when reading in Thy holy Word, 
 I pray that Thy glory may shine on each line, 
 That clearly I’ll see what a Savior I have 
 And how great salvation that Thou hast made mine.  When helpless I come, Lord, to kneel at Thy throne,  I pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace; 
 If thru my shortcomings Thou hear not my prayer, 
 Withdraw not Thy presence, O hide not Thy face. 
4 Each time when of heavenly blessings I think, 
 O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee; 
 My only hope here is Thy coming again, 
 My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be. 
 Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live, 
 From morning to evening my one world Thou art; 
 O let not my heart be contented or rest 
 When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.

3 亲近，更亲近，我惟属主，  罪恶与愚行甘心全脱除；  撇下罪中乐、骄傲、炫夸，  惟要得耶稣，并祂十字架。  惟要得耶稣，并祂十字架。 
4 亲近，更亲近，终生亲近，  直到荣耀里，我锚已抛稳；  亲近，更亲近，永远亲近，  更近我救主，与主更亲近。  更近我救主，与主更亲近。

9.10.9.10.10. WITH REPEAT 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart, 
 Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art; 
 Fold me, oh, fold me close to Thy breast, 
 Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest.” 
 Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest.” 
2 Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring, 
 Naught as an off’ring to Jesus, my King; 
 Only my sinful, now contrite heart, 
 Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,  Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart. 
3 Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine, 
 Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign; 
 All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride, 
 Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified, 
 Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified. 
4 Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last, 
 Till safe in glory my anchor is cast; 
 Thro’ endless ages, ever to be 
 Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee, 
 Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.

 “主，你旨意得成。”  
3 主阿，照你旨意， 
 一切都是美好； 
 每当环境更易， 
 欢然交你引导。

 生、死仍能唱吟： 
 “主，你旨意得成。”  
386 MY JESUS AS THOU WILT
1 My Jesus, as Thou wilt!

 And help me still to say, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done! 
2 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
 Though seen through many a tear,  Let not my star of hope 
 Grow dim or disappear; 
 Since Thou on earth hast wept,  And sorrowed oft alone, 
 If I must weep with Thee, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done! 
3 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
 All shall be well for me; 
 Each changing future scene 
 I gladly trust with Thee. 
 Straight to Thy rest above 
 I travel calmly on, 
 And sing, in life or death, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done!

 Time for me will be no more: 
 On that bright eternal shore, 
 I will walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.

 To the cross where Thou hast died; 
 Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, 
 To Thy precious, bleeding side. 
2 Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord, 
 By the pow’r of grace divine; 
 Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, 
 And my will be lost in Thine. 
3 O the pure delight of a single hour 
 That before Thy throne I spend, 
 When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,  I commune as friend with friend!

 Till Thy blessed face I see; 
 There are heights of joy that I yet may reach 
 Till I rest in peace with Thee.

391 主你作我的领港

391 JESUS SAVIOR PILOT ME
1 Jesus, Savior, pilot me 
 Over life’s tempestuous sea; 
 Unknown waves before me roll,  Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal;  Chart and compass come from Thee;  Jesus, Savior, pilot me. 
2 As a mother stills her child, 
 Thou canst hush the ocean wild;  Boist’rous waves obey Thy will  When Thou say’st to them, “Be still.”  Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,  Jesus, Savior, pilot me. 
3 Though death’s valley I may pass,  Still Thy grace will fear surpass;  In Thy presence I will rest, 
 And, while leaning on Thy breast,  I will hear Thee say to me, 
 “Fear not, I will pilot thee.”

3 你这圣洁、荣耀的主，  让我更多瞻仰； 
 无论快乐或是痛苦，  我愿作你活像。 
4 天上喜乐，求你膏我，  灵力，求你助我； 
 但愿你的热切爱火，  从我全人射过。 
5 可怜的己，愿其消沉，  惟你作我目标， 
 使我逐日藉着你恩，  更配与你相交。 
392 O JESUS CHRIST GROW THOU IN ME
1 O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, 
 And all things else recede; 
 My heart be daily nearer Thee, 
 From sin be daily freed. 
(C) Each day let Thy supporting might 
 My weakness still embrace; 
 My darkness vanish in Thy light, 
 Thy life my death efface. 
2 In Thy bright beams which on me fall, 
 Fade every evil thought; 
 That I am nothing, Thou art all, 
 I would be daily taught. 
3 More of Thy glory let me see, 
 Thou Holy, Wise, and True; 
 I would Thy living image be, 
 In joy and sorrow too. 
4 Fill me with gladness from above, 
 Hold me by strength divine; 
 Lord, let the glow of Thy great love 
 Through all my being shine. 
5 Make this poor self grow less and less, 
 Be Thou my life and aim; 
 Oh, make me daily through Thy grace 
 More meet to bear Thy name.

 That we could not but e’er fail You; 
 Yet there’s a message true, 
 The seed of life within us will break through —   Lord Jesus, grow in us. 
5 Make us in spirit poor; 
 Lord, take whate’er we think we know.  We’ll open to life’s flow, 
 And thus take in the life that makes us grow —   Lord Jesus, grow in us. 
6 Lord, make us pure in heart; 
 For we’ll not be content until 
 You all our being fill, 
 O Lord, renew our mind, emotion, will —   Lord Jesus, grow in us.

 That we must take You in each day; 
 The seed will have its way; 
 Your growing brings the kingdom here to stay —   Lord Jesus, grow in us.

 There’s nothing that Your life can’t do;  Our every part renew. 
 We’ll make it, we’ll make it just by You.  Lord Jesus, grow in us.

6.5.6.5.D. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 More holiness give me, More sweetness within,  More patience in suff’ring, More sorrow for sin,  More faith in my Savior, More sense of His care,  More joy in His service, More freedom in prayer. 
(C) Come, my Savior, and help me, 
 Comfort, strengthen and keep me; 
 Thou each moment wilt save me, 
 Thou art saving me now. 
2 More gratitude give me, More trust in the Lord,  More zeal for His glory, More hope in His Word,  More tears for His sorrows, More pain at His grief,  More meekness in trial, More praise for relief. 
3 More victory give me, More strength to o’ercome,  More freedom from earth-stains, More quest for the throne,  More fit for the kingdom, More useful I’d be,  More blessed and holy, More, Savior, like Thee.

396 主使我更爱你和你更亲密
1 主！使我更爱你，和你更亲密；  为你名更热心，向你话更信；  对你忧更关心，因你苦更贫；  更觉得你看顾，更完全顺服。 
和 求主天天扶持我，给我力量保守我，  使我一生走窄路，使主心满意足。 
2 主！使我更得胜，向你更忠诚，  在你手更有用，对你仇更勇，  受苦更为忍耐，犯罪更悲哀，  更喜乐任怨劳，更完全倚靠。 
3 主！使我更属天，更常见你面，  更爱慕你再来，更想你同在，  更愿意处卑微，更轻看高贵，  更不顾我自己，凡事更像你。

397 哦我要像你可爱的救主
1 哦，我要像你，可爱的救主！  这是我所求，是我所慕；  我欢喜丢弃一切的富足，  盼望能和你形像合符。 
和 哦，我要像你！哦，我要像你！  可爱的救主，像你模样；  像你的甘甜，像你的贞坚，  在我的衷心，刻你形像。 
2 哦，我要像你：那样的柔细，  宽恕又怜悯、仁爱、良善，  帮助孤单的，勉励灰心的，  寻找犯罪人，不辞危难。 
3 哦，我要像你：那样的忍耐，  圣洁而谦卑，于人无伤，  温柔地忍受无理的苦待，  宁可救别人，自己死亡。 
4 哦，我要像你！我今迫切求：  我愿出代价跟随你行， 
 将我的所是和我的所有，  完全献给你，不自经营。 
5 哦，我要像你！正当我祈求，  倒下你的爱充满我心， 
 使我作个殿，配给你居留，  使我的生命与你相印。 
397 O TO BE LIKE THEE BLESSED REDEEMER
1 O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer; 
 This is my constant longing and prayer; 
 Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, 
 Jesus,Thy perfect likeness to wear. 
(C) O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee! 
 Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; 
 Come in Thy sweetness, come inThy fullness;  StampThine own image deep on my heart. 
2 O to be like Thee! full of compassion, 
 Loving, forgiving, tender and kind, 
 Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, 
 Seeking the wand’ring sinners to find. 
3 O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming, 
 Now to receive th’ anointing divine; 
 All that I am and have I am bringing; 
 Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine. 
4 O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit, 
 Holy and harmless, patient and brave; 
 Meekly enduring cruel reproaches, 
 Willing to suffer, others to save. 
5 O to be like Thee! While I am pleading 
 Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love. 
 Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling, 
 Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.
398 从我活出你的自己
1 从我活出你的自己，  耶稣，你是我生命；  对于我的所有问题，  求你以你为答应。 
 从我活出你的自己，  一切事上能随意， 
 我不过是透明用器，  为着彰显你秘密。 
2 殿宇今已完全奉献，  已除所有的罪污， 
 但愿你的荣耀火焰，  今从里面来显露。  全地现在都当肃穆，  看我甘心献身体， 
 作你顺服、安静奴仆，  今后只被你加力。 
3 所有肢体每个时刻，  约束、等候你发言，  准备为你前来负轭，  或是不用放一边。 
 约束，没有不安追求，  没有紧张与受压， 
 没有因受对付怨尤，  没有因懊悔倒下。 
4 乃是柔软、安静、安息，  脱离倾向与成见， 
 让你能够自由定意，  当你对我有指点。  从我活出你的自己，  耶稣你是我生命； 
 对于我的所有问题，  求你以你为答应。 
398 LIVE THYSELF LORD JESUS THROUGH ME
1 Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me, 
 For my very life art Thou; 
 Thee I take to all my problems 
 As the full solution now. 
 Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me, 
 In all things Thy will be done; 
 I but a transparent vessel 
 To make visible the Son. 
2 Consecrated is Thy temple, 
 Purged from every stain and sin; 
 May Thy flame of glory now be 
 Manifested from within. 
 Let the earth in solemn wonder 
 See my body willingly 
 Offered as Thy slave obedient, 
 Energized alone by Thee. 
3 Every moment, every member, 
 Girded, waiting Thy command; 
 Underneath the yoke to labor 
 Or be laid aside as planned. 
 When restricted in pursuing, 
 No disquiet will beset; 
 Underneath Thy faithful dealing 
 Not a murmur or regret. 
4 Ever tender, quiet, restful, 
 Inclinations put away, 
 That Thou may for me choose freely 
 As Thy finger points the way. 
 Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me. 
 For my very life art Thou; 
 Thee I take to all my problems 
 As the full solution now.
399 世上景色我已一阅
1 世上景色我已一阅， 
 主，求使我目复盲； 
 不然，我怕你的喜悦， 
 不如从前的显彰。 
和 世上景色我已一阅， 
 主，求使我目复盲； 
 不然，我怕你的喜悦，  不如从前的显彰。 
 (这首诗是一位原来双目失明  的姊妹得医治后不久所写的)  
2 晨曦、晚霞、星光、云锦，  留等乐园再接触； 
 今天在此有主怜悯， 
 即使盲目亦满足。 
3 我今不望离开苦刺， 
 甘心软弱望加恩； 
 座上荣耀、幔内启示， 
 依然照亮无眼人。 
4 黑夜沉沉何等美丽， 
 用信摸索，不用眼； 
 祂受人欺，祂被人讥， 
 我见祂的发光脸。 
5 超过月亮，超过日头， 
 超过星河并云霄， 
 乃是那戴荆冕圣首 
 所显无比的荣耀。 
399 HAVING SEEN THE WORLD’S FAIR  BEAUTY
8.7.8.7. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Having seen the world’s fair beauty, 
 Lord, I would be blind once more, 
 Lest I lose the loving Presence 
 And Delight I knew before. 
(C) Having seen the world’s fair beauty, 
 Lord, I would be blind once more, 
 Lest I lose the loving Presence 
 And Delight I knew before. 
 (This hymn was written shortly after its author;  who had been born blind, gained her sight.) 
2 Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight, 
 I can see in paradise, 
 But while here on earth His mercy 
 For my blindness will suffice. 
3 I no more would be delivered 
 From my thom, but look for grace, 
 While within the veil His glory 
 Shineth brightly on my face. 
4 In the deep dark night, His beauty 
 I by faith, not sight, may trace; 
 He was ridiculed and hated, 
 Yet I see His glorious face. 
5 Sun and moonlight far surpassing, 
 Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread, 
 Is the glory all transcending 
 Shining from His thorn-crowned head.
400 指示你路我主指示你路
1 指示你路，我主，指示你路；  用你恩力赐助，使知你路。  助我行走不偏，凭信不凭眼见；  用光将我指点，使知你路。 
2 正当疑惧四涌，指示你路；  正当风雨蔽空，指示你路。  阳光破云而现，透过痛苦、愁烦；  使我前途平坦，指示你路。 
3 尽我一生年日，使知你路；  无论处何境遇，使知你路。  直到全程跑完，到达路终标竿，  赢得公义冠冕，使知你路。 
400 TEACH ME THY WAY O LORD TEACH ME  THY WAY
1 Teach me Thy way, O Lord, Teach me Thy way;  Thy gracious aid afford, Teach me Thy way. 
 Help me to walk aright; More by faith, less by sight;  Lead me with heav’nly light, Teach me Thy way. 
2 When doubts and fears arise, Teach me Thy way;  When storms o’erspread the skies, Teach me Thy way.  Shine thro’ the cloud and rain, Thro’ sorrow, toil, and pain;  Make Thou my pathway plain, Teach me Thy way. 
3 Long as my life shall last, Teach me Thy way;  
 Where’er my lot be cast, Teach me Thy way. 
 Until the race is run, Until the journey’s done, 
 Until the crown is won, Teach me Thy way.
401 主耶稣我真羡慕能得完全
1 主耶稣，我真羡慕能得完全，  我要你时刻活在我的魂间，  粉碎众偶像，驱逐所有失败，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
和 比雪更白，是比雪更白，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
2 主耶稣，不要让有”不圣”遗留，  求用你宝血除去所有污垢，  我为得圣洁，一切都愿割爱，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
3 主耶稣，求从天上宝座垂怜，  助我献完全的祭在你面前；  我放下自己和我所有障碍，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
4 主耶稣，为此，我今谦卑祈求，  在十字架下，我已等候很久，  你所流宝血，我今完全信赖，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
5 主耶稣，你已看见我在求寻，  求你今就来，赐给一个清心；  凡向你求的，你永不会不睬，  求主洗净我，使我比雪更白。 
401 LORD JESUS I LONG TO BE PERFECTLY  WHOLE
11.11.11.11. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole, 
 I want Thee forever to live in my soul; 
 Break down ev’ry idol, cast out ev’ry foe; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
(C) Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow; 
 Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. 
2 Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain, 
 Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;  To get this blest cleansing I all things forego; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
3 Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,  And help me to make a complete sacrifice; 
 I give up myself and whatever I know; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
4 Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat; 
 I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet; 
 By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
5 Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait; 
 Come now, and within me a new heart create; 
 To those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
402 哦神鉴察我心我行
1 哦神，鉴察我心我行，  显出我的真情， 
 照你火焰眼目所见，  将我道路全显。 
2 鉴察我的全部心意，  惟有你能洞悉， 
 愿我深处隐秘之域，  被你暴露无遗。 
3 情欲在彼辖制；
 苏醒良心，幡然醒悟，  知罪可恨、可恶。 
4 鉴察我的隐藏动机，  它常操纵、管理； 
 不洁事物在我心房，  竟作我魂之王。 
5 鉴察，直至如火眼目，  发光照透全部； 
 使我蒙恩被带你前，  向你俯伏、自谴。 
6 当我俯伏，从而学知，  我的软弱属实； 
 惟独我神在基督里，  才是爱的实际。 
402 SEARCH ME O GOD MY ACTIONS TRY
1 Search me, O God, my actions try, 
 And let my life appear 
 As seen by thine all-searching eye —  
 To mine my ways make clear. 
2 Search all my sense, and know my heart 
 Who only canst make known, 
 And let the deep, the hidden part 
 To me be fully shown. 
3 Throw light into the darkened cells, 
 Where passion reigns within; 
 Quicken my conscience till it feels 
 The loathsomeness of sin. 
4 Search all my thoughts, the secret springs, 
 The motives that control; 
 The chambers where polluted things 
 Hold empire o’er the soul. 
5 Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast 
 Its holy light through all, 
 And I by grace am brought at last 
 Before Thy face to fall. 
6 Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee, 
 What now I feebly prove, 
 That God alone in Christ can be 
 Unutterable love.
403 愿我全心颂赞我神
1 愿我全心颂赞我神，  因我完全脱罪； 
 宝血已经洒我良心，  我得平安无亏。 
2 在我亲爱救主座前，  我心柔顺、简单； 
 在此只闻基督之言，  在此耶稣掌权。 
3 此心谦卑、忧伤、痛悔，  因信得蒙洗净， 
 生死不能改我地位，  因主已住我心。 
4 所有心思都被更新，  并被你爱充满； 
 完全、正直、良善、纯真，  如同你的翻版。 
5 恩主，分赐你的性情，  愿你从天快临； 
 在我心上写你新名，  写你爱的美名。 
403 OH FOR A HEART TO PRAISE MY GOD
1 Oh, for a heart to praise my God, 
 A heart from sin set free, 
 A heart that’s sprinkled with the blood 
 So freely shed for me. 
2 A heart resigned, submissive, meek, 
 My dear Redeemer’s throne; 
 Where only Christ is heard to speak, 
 Where Jesus reigns alone. 
3 A humble, lowly, contrite heart, 
 Believing, true, and clean, 
 Which neither death nor life can part 
 From Him that dwells within. 
4 A heart in every thought renewed, 
 And filled with love divine; 
 Perfect and right, and pure and good, 
 A copy, Lord, of Thine. 
5 Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart, 
 Come quickly frown above; 
 Write Thy new name upon my heart, 
 Thy new, best name of Love.
404 清心的人有福
1 清心的人有福， 
 他们必得见神； 
 主的秘诀他们握住 -   让主安家于心。 
2 祂离天上居处， 
 带来生命、平安，  降卑自己，与人同住，  作人榜样、君王。 
3 来向卑微的人， 
 将祂自己分赐； 
 拣选那些清心的人，  使祂安家、管治。 
4 我寻求你同在， 
 愿主赐此福气； 
 赐我清洁谦卑、心怀，  供你居住、安息。 
404 BLESS’D ARE THE PURE IN HEART
1 Bless’d are the pure in heart, 
 For they shall see our God; 
 The secret of the Lord is theirs, 
 Their heart is Christ’s abode. 
2 The Lord, who left the heavens, 
 Our life and peace to bring, 
 To dwell in lowliness with men, 
 Their pattern and their King: 
3 He to the lowly soul 
 Doth still Himself impart, 
 And for His dwelling and His throne 
 Chooseth the pure in heart. 
4 Lord, we Thy presence seek; 
 May ours this blessing be; 
 Give us a pure and lowly heart, 
 A temple meet for Thee.
405 求主启示主自己
1 求主启示主自己，
 使我认识我肉体； 
 愿主恩典大作工， 
 使我俯伏灰尘中。 
 我虽羡慕能得胜， 
 终我一生总无能， 
 善虽愿意作不来， 
 恶虽恨恶脱不开。 
2 里面意思虽要神， 
 外头行为总可恨； 
 爱莫能助将奈何！ 
 事与愿违真束缚！ 
 神律才显罪便在， 
 善念一动恶也来； 
 肢体的律掳了我， 
 挣扎奋斗终难脱。 
3 多次跌倒多次起， 
 时而立志时而遗， 
 要求得胜反退溃， 
 愿意成圣倒污秽。 
 我实已是卖给罪， 
 我真已经无能为， 
 我的肉体没良善， 
 我的自己乃黑暗。 
4 我今已略识自己， 
 实在没有一点力， 
 我的性情真古怪， 
 我的生命全败坏； 
 自己诡诈不可靠， 
 肉体软弱不能保， 
 我今所有的盼望， 
 都在耶稣我的王。 
5 求主十架治死我， 
 使我靠主而生活； 
 求主圣灵充满我， 
 使我凭主而工作； 
 愿主的死在我身， 
 天天作工比前深， 
 让我自己全消灭， 
 让主生命来提挈。 
6 我的光景真是苦， 
 谁能使我不为奴， 
 救我脱离取死身， 
 使我能够常得胜？  耶稣为我流宝血， 
 基督作我的圣洁， 
我今接祂为生命， 
 我今服祂的号令。 
7 完全圣洁无恶意！ 
 完全顺服无自己！ 
 不再觉羞到父前！ 
 不再难过见主面！ 
 哦，这生命何等高！  一信主恩即临到！ 
 感谢主今听呼求， 
 使我完全得自由。 
405 LORD REVEAL THYSELF TO ME
1 Lord, reveal Thyself to me, 
 That the flesh I’ll fully know; 
 May Thy grace so work in me, 
 That in dust I’ll lowly bow. 
 How I long for victory, 
 Yet, thru all my life, how weak! 
 Evil things I cannot leave, 
 Nor can do the good I seek. 
2 Inwardly I want the Lord, 
 But my conduct hateful is; 
 Though I would, I cannot change, 
 O what real bondage ‘tis! 
 By God’s law my sin’s revealed, 
 But the law of sin doth bind; 
 Though I struggle to be free, 
 No release my soul can find. 
3 Many times I fall and rise, 
 Oft resolve, and often fail; 
 Craving vict’ry, I retreat, 
 And my sad defeat bewail. 
 Truly I am sold to sin 
 And completely powerless; 
 There’s no good within my flesh, 
 All is dark and sinfulness. 
4 Now I know myself in part, 
 And confess my helplessness; 
 All my temperament is odd, 
 All my life corrupted is. 
 Subtle self I cannot trust, 
 Nor to fleshly strength can cling; 
 All my trust and all my hope 
 Are in Jesus Christ my King. 
5 May the Cross put me to death 
 That on Christ I may rely; 
 May His Holy Spirit fill, 
 That Himself I may apply. 
 May His death so work in me 
 Daily deeper than before, 
 That my self may be destroyed 
 And His life thru me may pour. 
6 O how bitter is my case! 
 Who this wretched slave can free, 
 Who deliver from this death, 
 To a life of victory? 
 Jesus shed His blood for me, 
 Christ is now my holiness; 
 I receive Him as my life 
 And my portion measureless. 
7 Now I’m wholly sanctified, 
 Selfless, I obey His word; 
 Nevermore to feel ashamed 
 When I come before the Lord. 
 How transcendent is this life! 
 Grace thru faith He gives to me! 
 Praise the Lord, He heard my cry 
 And has made me wholly free.

406 主你知道所有干渴
1 主，你知道所有干渴，  在这不足寻求心；
 我心羡慕何等深刻，  惟你能使不饥馑。 
和 今寻求，今寻求，  赐你圣灵的富有。 
2 行为失败，见证失败，  工作失败已明显， 
 无果之劳、非主之态，  对你没有赞美献。 
3 我今向你承认我的  所有失败和罪愆， 
 所有自满，所有刚愎，  所有心里的恶念。 
4 父阿，救我脱离自己，  脱离化装的骄傲； 
 带我与主同到死地，  知道同钉的奇道。 
5 从今不再是我工作，  我想，我爱，或我说；  惟独乃是基督生活，  时时刻刻通过我。 
6 但愿你的满有圣灵，  流通在我的衷表， 
 好叫对人我是证明，  对你乃是归荣耀。 
7 父阿，我奉子名祷告，  我信祷告已答应， 
 我今赞美答应可靠，  安息只因话足凭。 
和 就赞美，就赞美，  因你已听我祷告。 
406 LORD THOU KNOWEST ALL THE HUNGER
1 Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger 
 Of the heart that seeks Thee now; 
 How my soul hath long been craving 
 What Thou only canst bestow. 
(C) Seeking now, seeking now, 
 Let Thy Spirit meet me now. 
2 Failure in my walk and witness, 
 Failure in my work I see; 
 Fruitless toil, un-Christlike living, 
 Calling forth no praise to Thee. 
3 Now to Thee my soul confesses 
 All its failure, all its sin; 
 All the pride, the self-contentment, 
 All the “secret faults” within. 
4 Save me from myself, my Father, 
 From each subtle form of pride; 
 Lead me now with Christ to Calvary, 
 Show me I with Him have died. 
5 No more let it be my working, 
 Nor my wisdom, love, or power, 
 But the life of Jesus only, 
 Passing through me hour by hour. 
6 Let the fullness of Thy Spirit 
 Resting on Him cover me, 
 That the witness borne to others, 
 May bring glory, Lord, to Thee. 
7 Father, in Thy Son’s Name, pleading, 
 I believe my prayer is heard; 
 And I praise Thee for the answer, 
 Resting simply on Thy word. 
(C) Praising now, praising now. 
 Thou hast answered, Lord, I know.
407 谦卑再谦卑来到你脚前
1 谦卑再谦卑，来到你脚前，  寻求你的灵，你怜悯何甜；  亲爱的救主，你前今俯伏，  谦卑再谦卑，一切都在主。 
和 谦卑再谦卑，十架之故，  世上的财富，视如粪土；  在你脚前，我今向你俯伏，  谦卑再谦卑，一切惟主！ 
2 谦卑再谦卑，我向主求告，  一天过一天，自己更减消；  软弱又不配，我心仰望你，  将我全倒空，用爱来充溢。 
3 谦卑再谦卑，我们反高升，  脱属地缠累，在主里上腾；  谦卑并顺服，走十架道路，  换荣耀冠冕，损失成益处。 
407 LOWER AND LOWER DEAR LORD AT THY  FEET
10.10.10.10. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet, 
 Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet; 
 Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall, 
 Lower and lower; be Thou all in all. 
(C) Lower and lower, down at Thy cross, 
 All the world’s treasure counting but dross; 
 Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall, 
 Lower, still lower, Christ all in all! 
2 Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray, 
 Losing the self-life still more every day; 
 Weak and unworthy, we’re looking above; 
 Empty us wholly; then fill us with love. 
3 Lower and lower; yet higher we rise, 
 Lifted in Christ, freed from all the earth ties; 
 Humbly we follow the way of the cross, 
 Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.

408 主阿求你将我看
1 主阿，求你将我看，  赐我甜美的简单；  灵中贫穷，心卑微，  寻求犹如向日葵。 
2 脱离作威的自己，  脱离财奴之所倚，  脱离显扬的兴趣，  脱离受夸的私欲。 
3 所有供我骄傲的，  求你为我全抛弃；  使我意志服你的，  谦卑顺服到死地。 
4 使我回转像婴孩，  将我智、力全毁坏；  只在你的光中行，  只靠你的能力动。 
5 倚在你爱的胸膛，  好像断奶的仰望；  感到神赐的平安，  充满在我全人间。 
6 让我活在这姿态，  天天满出赞美来，  如此到死也不变，  但我等候你显现。 
408 JESUS CAST A LOOK ON ME
1 Jesus, cast a look on me; 
 Give me sweet simplicity; 
 Make me poor, and keep me low,  Seeking only Thee to know. 
2 Weaned from all my lordly self, 
 Weaned from all the miser’s pelf,  Weaned from all the scorner’s ways,  Weaned from all the lust of praise. 
3 All that feeds my busy pride, 
 Cast it evermore aside; 
 Bid my will to Thine submit, 
 Lay me humbly at Thy feet. 
4 Make me like a little child, 
 Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;  Seeing only in Thy light, 
 Walking only in Thy might; 
5 Leaning on Thy loving breast, 
 Where a weary soul may rest; 
 Feeling well the peace of God 
 Flowing from Thy precious blood. 
6 In this posture let me live, 
 And hosannas daily give; 
 In this temper let me die, 
 And hosannas ever cry.

409 你这神的隐藏的爱
1 你这神的隐藏的爱！ 
 长阔高深无人知悉， 
 远远我见你的光彩， 
 我就叹息望得安息； 
 我心痛苦，不能安息，  除非我心安息于你。 
2 你的声音，仍然隐招  我来负你甜美的轭； 
 我虽几乎前来应召， 
 但是惧怕前途阻隔； 
 我志虽定，我情却离，  我欲向你，反而背你。 
3 全是恩典！使你吸引  我心向你追求安息； 
 我虽追求，不能亲近，  流荡的我无所凭倚； 
 哦，要何时不再流荡，  所有脚踪向你而往？ 
4 日下有无什么东西， 
 与你相争来分我心？ 
 哦，我求你把它割弃，  让你作王无人与竞； 
 我心才会不再拘泥， 
 当它藉你得了安息。 
5 哦，我求你埋藏这己，  使主(非我)从我而活！  恶欲邪情钉死绝迹， 
 不私留一宝贝罪恶； 
 除你之外，在凡事上，  使我无求，使我无望！ 
6 哦主，给我无上之助，  救我脱离无用之虑； 
 赶出己意离我心府， 
 离我全人隐密之域； 
 使我作个顺命的人， 
 不断称颂阿爸的名。 
7 求你使我时刻离地， 
 谦卑等候听你吩咐； 
 求你对我时常题起： 
 “我是你爱、你命、你主；”   来听你声，来觉你力，  来尝你爱，是我所期。 
409 THOU HIDDEN LOVE OF GOD WHOSE  HEIGHT
1 Thou hidden love of God, whose height, 
 hose depth unfathomed no man knows, 
 I see from far Thy beauteous light, 
 Inly I sigh for Thy repose; 
 My heart is pained, nor can it be 
 At rest, till it finds rest in Thee. 
2 Thy secret voice invites me still 
 The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove; 
 And fain I would: but though my will 
 Seems fixed, yet wide my passions rove; 
 Yet hindrances strew all the way; 
 I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray. 
3 ‘Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought 
 My mind to seek her peace in Thee; 
 Yet, while I seek but find Thee not, 
 No peace my wand’ring soul shall see. 
 Oh, when shall all my wand’rings end, 
 And all my steps to Thee-ward tend! 
4 Is there a thing beneath the sun 
 That strives with Thee my heart to share? 
 Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone, 
 The Lord of every motion there. 
 Then shall my heart from earth be free, 
 When it has found repose in Thee. 
5 Oh, hide this self from me, that I 
 No more, but Christ in me may live; 
 My vile affections mortify, 
 Nor let one darling sin survive. 
 In all things nothing may I see, 
 Nothing desire or seek but Thee. 
6 O Lord, Thy sovereign aid impart, 
 To save me from low-thoughted care; 
 Chase this self-will through all my heart, 
 Through all its latent mazes there, 
 Make me Thy duteous child, that I 
 Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry. 
7 Each moment draw from earth away 
 My heart which lowly waits Thy call; 
 Speak to my inmost soul and say, 
 “I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy All.” 
 To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice, 
 To taste Thy love, be all my choice.
410 耶稣我救主是你感动我心
1 耶稣我救主，是你感动我心，  使冷淡焚烧，驱尽我阴影，  拆毁我障碍，吸引我更亲近，  使我认识你是我的生命。 
2 更深地挖我，除我肤浅行为；  使我脱困惑，灵自由如飞；  求我主速速解开一切缠累；  除尽我身上每一丝虚伪。 
3 哦，圣风来吹，哦，求圣火来焚；  神宝剑！醒起治死我肉体。
410 JESUS REDEEMER AND MY ONE INSPIRER
1 Jesus, Redeemer and my one Inspirer, 
 Heat in my coldness, set my life aglow. 
 Break down my barriers; draw, yea, draw me nigher.  Thee would I know, whom it is life to know. 
2 Deepen me, rid me of the superficial; 
 From pale delusion set my spirit free; 
 All the entangled in me quick unravel; 
 Pluck forth each thread of insincerity. 
3 Thy vows are on me, oh to serve Thee truly —  
 Love perfectly, in purity obey —  
 Burn, burn, O Fire. O Wind, now winnow throughly;  O Sword, awake against the flesh and slay.

411 我以信心仰望
1 我以信心仰望 
 你在十字架上， 
 我的救主！ 
 求你听我祷告， 
 将我罪过宽饶， 
 使我从今到老， 
 全属救主。 
2 主，赐能力、恩惠，  在这软弱心内， 
 热情鼓舞！ 
 你既为我流血， 
 我要爱你深切， 
 真挚、长久、纯洁，  如火如荼。 
3 我今行走世路， 
 四围痛苦密布； 
 求你引领！ 
 擦干我的眼泪， 
 保守我不懊悔， 
 拯救我不犯罪， 
 贻羞你名。 
4 人生短梦一过， 
 死河要起寒波， 
 将我淹没； 
 那时求主恩惠， 
 除我疑惑、惊畏，  带我平安而归， 
 永远快乐。 
411 MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE
1 My faith looks up to Thee, 
 Thou Lamb of Calvary, 
 Savior Divine; 
 Now hear me while I pray; 
 Take all my guilt away; 
 Oh, let me from this day 
 Be wholly Thine. 
2 May Thy rich grace impart 
 Strength to my fainting heart, 
 My zeal inspire; 
 As Thou hast died for me, 
 Oh, may my love to Thee 
 Pure, warm, and changeless be, 
 A living fire. 
3 While life’s dark maze I tread, 
 And griefs around me spread, 
 Be Thou my Guide; 
 Bid darkness turn to day, 
 Wipe sorrow’s tears away, 
 Nor let me ever stray 
 From Thee aside. 
4 When ends life’s transient dream, 
 When death’s cold, sullen stream, 
 Shall o’er me roll; 
 Blest Savior, then, in love, 
 Fear and distrust remove; 
 Oh, bear me safe above, 
 A ransomed soul.

412 神圣的爱何其美甜
1 是爱、光和生命
1 神圣的爱，何其美甜！  我心何时方才甘愿 
 完全被你领率？ 
 我的饥灵渴望证明，  救赎的爱何其中肯 
 基督对我的爱！ 
2 祂爱强过阴间、死亡，  丰富超人测度力量：  光明首生众子， 
 空想要识爱的原本，  何长、何阔、何高、何深，  奥秘不得而知。 
3 只有神知神的大爱，  但愿现今就被灌溉，  在这如石心肠； 
 为爱我叹，为爱我闷，  主，我祈求只这一分，  更好福分恩赏。 
4 但愿我同马利亚， 
 永远安坐在主脚下；  这是我心所选； 
 来听良人，是我惟一  羡慕、爱好、喜乐、安息，  使我在地若天。 
412 O LOVE DIVINE HOW SWEET THOU ART
1 O Love divine, how sweet Thou art, 
 When shall I find my willing heart 
 All taken up by Thee? 
 My thirsty spirit faints to prove 
 The greatness of redeeming love, 
 The love of Christ to me. 
2 Stronger His love than death and hell, 
 Its riches are unsearchable: 
 The first-born sons of light 
 Desire in vain its depths to see; 
 They cannot reach the mystery, 
 The length, and breadth, and height. 
3 God only knows the love of God; 
 Oh, that it now were shed abroad 
 In this poor stony heart; 
 For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
 This only portion, Lord, be mine, 
 Be mine this better part. 
4 Oh, that I could forever sit 
 Like Mary, at the Master’s feet; 
 Be this my happy choice; 
 My only care, delight, and bliss, 
 My joy, my rest on earth be this, 
 To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.
413 恩惠圣灵我导师
1 是爱、光和生命
1 恩惠圣灵我导师， 
 感动我心来等待， 
 五旬所赐的恩赐： 
 属天的圣爱。 
2 虽有移山的信心、 
 知识、万人的方言，  却无属天的爱心， 
 一切仍枉然。 
3 虽我殉道并舍己， 
 一切为穷人倾倒， 
 若是无爱仍空虚； 
 “爱”是我所要。 
4 爱是温柔、肯原谅，  爱是仁慈、常忍耐，  这爱比死更坚强； 
 主，赐我这爱。 
5 讲道之能和知识， 
 有日终必归无有； 
 惟有爱永无终日； 
 “爱”是我所求。 
6 如今主里所常存， 
 有信，有望，并有爱，  有如三股合成绳， 
 但最大是爱。 
413 GRACIOUS SPIRIT HOLY GHOST
1 Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost, 
 Taught by You, we covet most, 
 Of Your gifts at Pentecost, 
 Holy heavenly love. 
2 Faith that mountains could remove, 
 Tongues of earth or heaven above, 
 Knowledge, all things, empty prove 
 Without heavenly love. 
3 Love is kind, and suffers long, 
 Love is meek, and thinks no wrong, 
 Love than death itself more strong: 
 Therefore give us love. 
4 Though I as a martyr bleed, 
 Give my goods the poor to feed, 
 All is vain if love I need; 
 Therefore give me love. 
5 Prophecy will fade away 
 Melting in the light of day; 
 Love will ever with us stay: 
 Therefore give us love. 
6 Faith, and hope, and love we see 
 Joining hand in hand, agree; 
 But the greatest of the three, 
 And the best, is love.
414 主阿你的无限大爱
1 是爱、光和生命
1 主阿，你的无限大爱，  我口难述，我心难领；  被你吸引，我心感戴，  让你作王，无人可竞；  愿主爱火将我点起， 
 完全献上，单单归你。 
2 愿我里面，别无他物，  只让你的纯爱居住；  你爱占有我的全部，  作我喜乐、冠冕、财富；  所有冷淡消除净尽，  让爱充满每一言行。 
3 爱的光辉使我欢欣，  所有痛苦消踪无影；  挂虑、忧愁融化消尽，  当你医治光线射进；  主，我只要见你荣面，  别无他求，别无他愿。 
414 O LORD THY BOUNDLESS LOVE TO ME
1 O Lord, Thy boundless love to me 
 No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
 Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee, 
 And reign without a rival there; 
 Thine wholly, Thine alone I am; 
 Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame. 
2 Oh, grant that nothing in my soul 
 May dwell but Thy pure love alone; 
 Oh, may Thy love possess me whole, 
 My joy, my treasure, and my crown; 
 All coldness from my heart remove; 
 May every act, word, thought, be love. 
3 O Love, how cheering is Thy ray, 
 All pain before Thy presence flies; 
 Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away, 
 Where’er Thy healing beams arise; 
 Lord Jesus, nothing may I see, 
 And naught desire, or seek, but Thee.
415 恳求我主鉴察我的心思
1 恳求我主，鉴察我的心思，  求主察验我，知道我心事；  看我里面，有何恶心存留？  洗去每一罪污，使我自由。 
2 赞美我主，你已洁净我罪，  实现你应许，纯净我心内。  求以灵火，洁净已往羞情，  我只渴慕能够荣耀你名。 
3 主，占有我，使我完全归你，  以你大爱，充满贫穷心里；  夺我深处骄傲、情欲、意志，  我今降服，求主与我同止。 
4 先在我心工作；  你既宣告供给我们需要，  为这祝福，我今迫切祷告。
415 SEARCH ME O GOD AND KNOW MY HEART  TODAY
1 Search me, O God, and know my heart today; 
 Try me, O Savior, know my thoughts, I pray. 
 See if there be some wicked way in me; 
 Cleanse me from every sin and set me free. 
2 I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin; 
 Fulfill Thy Word and make me pure within. 
 Fill me with fire where once I burned with shame; 
 Grant my desire to magnify Thy name. 
3 Lord, take my life and make it wholly Thine; 
 Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine. 
 Take all my will, my passion, self and pride; 
 I now surrender, Lord — in me abide. 
4 O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee; 
 Send a revival — start the work in me. 
 Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need; 
 For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
416 主你爱的光正在照耀
1 是爱、光和生命
1 主，你爱的光正在照耀， 
 在黑暗中如明光照耀； 
 耶稣，世上真光，照亮我们， 
 用真理来释放、引导我们； 
 光照我，光照我。 
和 耶稣，光照！ 
 将父的荣耀充满这地； 
 圣灵，焚烧！从我心烧起。 
 活水，涌流！将恩典、怜悯泛滥全地；  赐下你话，主，并发光不已！ 
2 主，我进到你可畏面前， 
 从荫蔽处进入你光线； 
 靠宝血我得进入你光明， 
 察我，试我，除我一切阴影， 
 光照我，光照我。 
3 我们注视你君尊荣光， 
 脸上便得显出你形像； 
 不断变化，以致荣上加荣， 
 如同镜子返照你的荣形， 
 光照我，光照我。 
416 LORD THE LIGHT OF YOUR LOVE IS  SHINING
9.9.10.10.6. WITH CHORUS 
Seeking the Lord 
1 Lord, the light of Your love is shining, 
 In the midst of the darkness shining; 
 Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us; 
 Set us free by the truth You now bring us, 
 Shine on me, shine on me. 
(C) Shine, Jesus, shine, 
 Fill this land with the Father’s glory; 
 Blaze, Spirit, blaze, Set our hearts on fire. 
 Flow, River, flow,Flood the nations with grace and glory;  Send forth Your Word, Lord, and let there be light. 
2 Lord, I come to Your awesome presence, 
 From the shadows into Your radiance; 
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness, 
 Search me, try me, consume all my darkness,  Shine on me, shine on me. 
3 As we gaze on Your kingly brightness, 
 So our faces display Your likeness; 
 Ever changing from glory to glory, 
 Mirror’d here may our lives tell Your story,  Shine on me, shine on me.
417 平安作我心中主
1 平安作我心中主； 
 吩咐躁心要安静； 
 忧虑、疑惧皆消除；  催使我灵入安宁。 
2 你用己血将我买， 
 归神之门已敞开； 
 我求平安，平安来，  因我与主不离开。 
3 愿你旨意得成全； 
 使你旨成我心愿； 
 心中疑惑你消散， 
 赐下你完全平安。 
4 救主，我伏你脚前，  你是我命、我一切；  作你仆人到永远， 
 愿我与你永联结。 
417 PRINCE OF PEACE CONTROL MY WILL
1 Prince of peace, control my will; 
 Bid this struggling heart be still: 
 Bid my fears and doubtings cease: 
 Hush my spirit into peace. 
2 Thou hast bought me with Thy blood, 
 Opened wide the gate to God; 
 Peace I ask, but peace must be, 
 Lord, in being one with Thee. 
3 May Thy will, not mine be done; 
 May Thy will and mine be one; 
 Chase these doubtings from my heart, 
 Now Thy perfect peace impart. 
4 Savior, at Thy feet I fall, 
 Thou, my life, my God, my all; 
 Let Thy happy servant be 
 One forevermore with Thee.
418 当我凭着自己思想
1 当我凭着自己思想， 
 我觉自己很是刚强， 
 不知自己却是怎样没有力量。 
2 当我生活世人中间， 
 我尚不觉自己亏欠， 
 只觉自己如何奋勉， 
 如何上前。 
3 当我住在黑暗里面， 
 我就不知自己肤浅， 
 以为自己何等无限， 
 不必虚谦。 
4 当我来到你的面前， 
 亮光剌破遮蔽幕帘， 
 我就看见前所未见， 
 完全露现。 
5 在你面前我只萎缩， 
 一切萎缩、一切消没，  所有骄傲都变软弱， 
 都变赤裸。 
6 所有骄傲都是愚昧， 
 看见实在何必谦卑， 
 所有自恃都是因为， 
 心中墨黑。 
7 没有可骄，没有可傲，  没有可倚，没有可靠，  只有自惭，只有自懊，  能否祷告？ 
8 幸有你血免我定罪， 
 你的生命免我销毁， 
 但我真是何等污秽， 
 何等惭愧。 
9 我要祷告，没有信心，  我要倚靠，如何求寻？  不知如何方能重新…   主阿怜悯！ 
418 WHEN I AM IN THE NATURAL MAN
1 When I am in the natural man, 
 How very strong I feel I am, 
 I do not know, I cannot scan How weak I am. 
2 When in the world I have my life, 
 I cannot sense my failure rife, 
 But boasting in my earnest strife, 
 I forward press. 
3 When I within the darkness dwell, 
 My shallow state I cannot tell, 
 I only think how I excel, 
 And proudly dream. 
4 But when at last I come to Thee, 
 Thy searching light uncovers me, 
 I see what I could never see —  
 Myself exposed. 
5 I wither ‘neath Thy piercing ray, 
 And all my strength dissolves away, 
 My self-esteem in dust I lay, 
 And lowly bow. 
6 How blind and foolish is the pride 
 With which my soul was fortified; 
 From my dark heart, self-satisfied, 
 It issued forth. 
7 There’s not a thing that pride can claim, 
 There’s not a member but is lame, 
 There’s only deep regret and shame, 
 How can I pray? 
8 Thy blood from judgment saveth me, 
 Thy life from wrath delivers me, 
 How filthy yet in poverty 
 I really am. 
9 I want to pray, but faith have not, 
 I fain would seek Thee as Thou art. 
 Oh, canst Thou e’er renew my heart, 
 Have mercy, Lord!
419 我是属主这个喜乐真难述
1 我是属主！这个喜乐真难述，  答应主召呼，甜美又满足；  跟从我主，祂以柔声向我诉：  “莫怕！你属我，我已将你赎！”  
2 我是属主！这是欢乐的宣告，  像大喜日子，新妇的夸耀：  “我愿永远爱祂，尊祂，接受祂，  无论何境遇，都愿顺从祂。”  
3 我是属主！这个意义真丰富：  因爱的缘故，忠心事奉主，  一切事上，都愿绝对的降服，  丝毫无保留，来向你顺服。 
4 我是属主！灵、魂、身体，我全部，  保守并坚固，属你不反复；  像你，恩主，满了恩典和丰富，  一直到永远仍然是我主。 
419 I AM THE LORD’S O JOY BEYOND  EXPRESSION
1 I am the Lord’s! O joy beyond expression,  O sweet response to voice of love Divine;  Faith’s joyous “Yes” to the assuring whisper,  “Fear not! I have redeem’d thee; thou art Mine.” 
2 I am the Lord’s! It is the glad confession  Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,  When love’s “I will” accepted Him forever,  “The Lord’s,” to love, to honor and obey. 
3 I am the Lord’s! Yet teach me all it meaneth,  All it involves of love and loyalty, 
 Of holy service, absolute surrender, 
 And unreserved obedience unto Thee. 
4 I am the Lord’s! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,  O seal them irrecoverably Thine; 
 As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fullness  Forever and forevermore art mine.
420 我主大爱长阔高深
1 我主大爱长阔高深，  实在不能推测；
 不然，像我这样罪人，  怎能满被恩泽？ 
 怎能满被恩泽？ 
2 我主耶稣出了重价，  买我回来归祂； 
 我今愿意背十字架，  忠心一路跟祂。 
 忠心一路跟祂。 
3 我今愿意撇下一切，  为要得着基督； 
 生也、死也，想都不屑，  有何使我回顾？ 
 有何使我回顾？ 
4 亲友、欲好、雄心、利名，  于我夫复何用？ 
 恩主为我变作苦贫，  我今为主亦穷。 
 我今为主亦穷。 
5 我爱我的宝贵救主，  我求祂的称是； 
 为祂之故，安逸变苦，  利益变为损失。 
 利益变为损失。 
6 你是我的惟一安慰，  我的恩主耶稣！ 
 除你之外，在天何归？  在地何所爱慕？ 
 在地何所爱慕？ 
7 虽遇艰苦、反对、飘零，  我今一起不理； 
 只求我主用你爱情，  绕我灵、魂、身体。  绕我灵、魂、身体。 
8 主阿，我今恳切求你，  施恩引导小子， 
 立在我旁，常加我力，  过此黑暗罪世。 
 过此黑暗罪世。 
9 撒但、世界、加上肉体，  时常试探欺凌； 
 你若不加小子能力，  恐将贻羞你名！ 
10 现今时候已经不多，  求主使我脱尘； 
 你一再来，我即唱说：  阿利路亚！阿们！ 
 阿利路亚！阿们！ 
420 HOW VAST IMMENSE AND MEASURELESS
1 How vast, immense, and measureless, 
 The love of Christ to 
 How else could such a wretch as I 
 Be blessed so wondrously? 
 Be blessed so wondrously? 
2 To bring me back unto Himself, 
 My Lord His all did spend; 
 So I would gladly bear the cross 
 And follow to the end. 
 And follow to the end. 
3 My all I have forsaken now, 
 This blessed Christ to gain; 
 Now life or death is no concern —  
 What else can me restrain? 
 What else can me restrain? 
4 My dear ones, wealth, ambition, fame —  
 What can they offer me? 
 My gracious Lord for me was poor; 
 For Him I poor would be. 
 For Him I poor would be. 
5 My precious Savior now I love, 
 His smile I would obtain. 
 For Him, let gain be turned to loss 
 And comfort turned to pain. 
 And comfort turned to pain. 
6 Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord! 
 I’ve none in heav’n but Thee. 
 And who but Thee is there on earth 
 With whom I love to be? 
 With whom I love to be? 
7 Though loneliness and hardships come, 
 My soul can rise above. 
 This only would I ask Thee, Lord: 
 Enfold me in Thy love! 
 Enfold me in Thy love! 
8 O gracious Lord, I now beseech, 
 Guide me through every stage; 
 Stand by and strengthen me to go 
 Through this dark, evil age. 
 Through this dark, evil age. 
9 The world, the flesh, and Satan too, 
 Do tempt my soul apace; 
 Without Thy love and strength’ning power 
 I may Thy name disgrace. 
10 The time, dear Lord, is short indeed; 
 From earth my soul set free. 
 When Thou dost come, I’ll sing with joy, 
 Hallelujah, Lord, to Thee! 
 Hallelujah, Lord, to Thee!
421 哦那不肯放我之爱
1 哦，那不肯放我之爱，  我将疲魂安息于你；  我把所欠余生归来，  好使它在你这深海，  得更丰满洋溢。 
2 哦，那照耀我路之光，  我将残灯带来交你；  我心因得你光复亮，  它的日子藉你太阳，  得更光明美丽。 
3 哦，那喜乐寻我苦中，  我心不能向你关闭；  我在雨中寻得彩虹，  知你应许必不落空，  天亮便无泪涕。 
4 哦，那使我抬头十架，  我不敢求与你稍离；  今生虚荣死葬土下，  那土长出生命红花，  永远开放不已。 
421 O LOVE THAT WILT NOT LET ME GO
1 O Love, that wilt not let me go, 
 I rest my weary soul in Thee; 
 I give Thee back the life I owe, 
 That in Thine ocean depths its flow 
 May richer, fuller be. 
2 O Light, that followest all my way, 
 I yield my flickering torch to Thee; 
 My heart restores its borrowed ray, 
 That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day 
 May brighter, fairer be. 
3 O Joy, that seekest me through pain, 
 I cannot close my heart to Thee; 
 I trace the rainbow through the rain, 
 And feel the promise is not vain 
 That morn shall tearless be. 
4 O Cross, that liftest up my head, 
 I dare not ask to fly from Thee; 
 I lay in dust life’s glory dead, 
 And from the ground there blossoms red 
 Life that shall endless be.
422 主你得胜我今降服
1 主，你得胜，我今降服；  恩典深厚，能不屈服？  能不全献给主？ 
 你若施压，我会不顾，  但对你爱，谁能逆拂？  你爱把我征服！ 
2 你若命令万钧雷霆，  轰我灵魂向我施刑，  我仍固执不悔； 
 但你怜悯征服我心，  救主流血，为我受刑，  现今我恨我罪。 
3 我今羡慕单单归你，  请来占有我这陋器，  因你将我释放； 
 我既脱离撒但暴政，  愿我全人听你使令，  今后让你执掌。 
422 LORD THOU HAST WON AT LENGTH I  YIELD
1 Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield; 
 My heart by mighty grace compelled 
 Surrenders all to Thee; 
 Against Thy terrors long I strove, 
 But who can stand against Thy love? 
 Love conquers even me. 
2 If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll, 
 And light’nings flash, to blast my soul, 
 I still had stubborn been; 
 But mercy has my heart subdued, 
 A bleeding Savior I have viewed, 
 And now I hate my sin. 
3 Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone, 
 Come, take possession of Thine own, 
 For Thou hast set me free; 
 Released from Satan’s hard command, 
 See all my powers waiting stand, 
 To be employed by Thee.
423 为你我流宝血
1 “为你，我流宝血，
 为你，我舍生命， 
 将你洗得清洁， 
 使你从死复生。 
 为你，为你，我舍生命，  为我，你舍何情？ 
2 为你，我费多年， 
 历尽劳苦灾殃， 
 好使欢乐永远， 
 你也得以安享。 
 为你，为你，我费多年，  为我，你费几天？ 
3 我父光明之家， 
 我的荣耀宝座， 
 为你，我都撇下， 
 来到苦地飘泊。 
 为你，为你，我撇这些，  为我，你何所撇？ 
4 为你，我受多苦， 
 过于你口能述， 
 受了极大痛楚， 
 救你脱离阴府。 
 为你，为你，我受多苦，  为我，你肯何负？ 
5 从我天上之家， 
 为你，我已带来： 
 救恩无以复加， 
 赦免陪同慈爱。 
 为你，为你，我带许多，  为我，你带什么？”  
6 “主，我献上生命， 
 并献所有时光， 
 完全听你使令， 
 脱离地上捆绑。 
 为我，为我，你的全舍，  为你，我撇一切！”  
423 THY LIFE WAS GIV’N FOR ME
1 Thy Life was giv’n for me, 
 Thy blood, O Lord, was shed, 
 That I might ransomed be, 
 And quickened from the dead; 
 Thy Life was giv’n for me, for me;  What have I giv’n for Thee? 
2 Long years were spent for me 
 In weariness and woe, 
 That through eternity 
 Thy glory I might know; 
 Long years were spent for me, for me;  Have I spent one for Thee? 
3 Thy Father’s home of light, 
 Thy rainbow-circled throne, 
 Were left for earthly night, 
 For wanderings sad and lone; 
 Yea, all was left for me, for me; 
 Have I left aught for Thee? 
4 Thou, Lord, hast borne for me 
 More than my tongue can tell 
 Of bitterest agony, 
 To rescue me from hell; 
 Thou suff’redst all for me, for me; 
 What have I borne for Thee? 
5 And Thou hast brought to me 
 Down from Thy home above 
 Salvation full and free, 
 Thy pardon and Thy love; 
 Great gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;  What have I brought to Thee? 
6 Oh, let my life be given, 
 My years for Thee be spent; 
 World-fetters all be riven, 
 And joy with suffr’ing blent; 
 Thou gav’st Thyself for me, for me,  I give myself to Thee.
424 你灵岂非已见祂过
1 你灵岂非已见祂过？
 你心曾否被祂夺？ 
 祂是人中之第一人； 
 欣选那上好福分。 
和 你是人中之第一人，  求开我眼、夺我心，  摔碎偶像，欢然加冠  你这人中第一人！ 
2 世界一切虚荣、珍宝，  是偶像，使人颠倒； 
 镀金，使人不易淡泊，  浸蜜，使人难超脱。 
3 什么能使地上偶像， 
 失去它美丽模样？ 
 不是灰心、失望、劝勉，  乃”无价之宝”一现！ 
4 并非因它本是虚无， 
 使偶像化成灰土； 
 乃是祂美丽的倾注， 
 并祂爱心的流露。 
5 谁愿熄灭他的灯光， 
 若非朝阳已在望？ 
 谁愿收藏他的寒衣， 
 若非炎夏已经莅？ 
6 惟有彼得所见泪眼， 
 司提反所望荣脸， 
 陪马利亚同哭慈心， 
 使我脱地的吸引。 
7 求你来施情并吸引， 
 直到你充满这心； 
 我们既是你的同伴， 
 与偶像有何相干？ 
424 HAST THOU HEARD HIM SEEN HIM  KNOWN HIM
8.7.8.7. WITH CHORUS 
Consecrating to the Lord 
1 Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?  Is not thine a captured heart? 
 Chief among ten thousand own Him; 
 Joyful choose the better part. 
(C) Captivated by His beauty, 
 Worthy tribute haste to bring; 
 Let His peerless worth constrain thee, 
 Crown Him now unrivaled King. 
2 Idols once they won thee, charmed thee, 
 Lovely things of time and sense; 
 Gilded thus does sin disarm thee, 
 Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence. 
3 What has stripped the seeming beauty 
 From the idols of the earth? 
 Not a sense of right or duty, 
 But the sight of peerless worth. 
4 Not the crushing of those idols, 
 With its bitter void and smart; 
 But the beaming of His beauty, 
 The unveiling of His heart. 
5 Who extinguishes their taper 
 Till they hail the rising sun? 
 Who discards the garb of winter 
 Till the summer has begun? 
6 ‘Tis that look that melted Peter, 
 ‘Tis that face that Stephen saw, 
 ‘Tis that heart that wept with Mary, 
 Can alone from idols draw: 
7 Draw and win and fill completely, 
 Till the cup o’erflow the brim; 
 What have we to do with idols 
 Who have companied with Him?
425 我将一切全献基督
1 我将一切全献基督， 
 全献恩主心甘愿； 
 我要永远爱主，随主， 
 天天活在主面前。 
和 一切全奉献！一切全奉献！  我的恩主，向你我愿一切全奉献！ 
2 我将一切全献基督， 
 我今俯伏主脚前； 
 今世福乐永不我属， 
 恩主，收我在今天。 
3 我将一切全献基督， 
 恩主，将我全得着。 
 惟愿圣灵从我证出： 
 我是属主，主属我。 
4 我将一切全献基督， 
 主，我愿作你器皿； 
 恩惠、能力充我如注， 
 显明你生在我身。 
5 我将一切全献基督， 
 圣火已将我烧净； 
 哦，这救恩甜美丰富， 
 荣耀、荣耀归主名。 
425 ALL TO JESUS I SURRENDER
1 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 All to Him I freely give; 
 I will ever love and trust Him, 
 In His presence daily live. 
(C) I surrender all, I surrender all. 
 All to Thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all. 
2 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Humbly at His feet I bow, 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken; 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now. 
3 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Make me, Savior, wholly Thine; 
 Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit, 
 Truly know that Thou art mine. 
4 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Lord, I give myself to Thee; 
 Fill me with Thy love and power, 
 Let Thy blessing fall on me. 
5 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Now I feel the sacred flame. 
 Oh, the joy of full salvation! 
 Glory, glory to His name!

426 你希望常平安信心增长不断
1 你希望常平安，信心增长不断，  为此你虔求、望主成全； 
 但不觉有安息，祝福也未多见，  直到把一切献于祭坛。 
和 你是否把一切都奉献于祭坛？  你心是否让灵掌管？ 
 你若要心平安，满有安息、甘甜，  只有把全人献于祭坛。 
2 你愿否在主话光中与祂同行，  常享满足、喜乐与平安？ 
 你须遵行主旨，远离一切恶行，  并须把一切献于祭坛。 
3 我虽祷告寻求，但永不能认识  主所赐祝福何等丰满， 
 直等到我身心全归恩主管制，  并把我一切献于祭坛。 
4 谁能尽述祂那从天倾下爱怜？  哦，我心因此何等畅欢！ 
 哦，在祂的脚前，交通何等甘甜！  当我们一切献于祭坛。 
426 YOU HAVE LONGED FOR SWEET PEACE  AND FOR FAITH TO INCREASE
12.9.12.9. WITH CHORUS 
Consecrating to the Lord 
1 You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase,  And have earnestly, fervently prayed; 
 But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest, 
 Until all on the altar is laid. 
(C) Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? 
 Your heart, does the Spirit control? 
 You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,  As you yield Him your body and soul. 
2 Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,  And have peace and contentment alway; 
 You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill;  On the altar your all you must lay. 
3 Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow  Of the blessings for which we have prayed, 
 Till our body and soul He doth fully control, 
 And our all on the altar is laid. 
4 Who can tell all the love He will send from above!  Oh, how happy our heart will be made! 
 Oh, what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet,  When our all on the altar is laid!

427 主你得着我一生
1 主，你得着我一生，  使它归你成为圣；
 得着我日与我时， 
 归你使用永无止， 
 归你使用永无止， 
2 得我双手为你用， 
 因爱催促才举动； 
 得我两足为你行， 
 踪迹佳美传你名。 
 踪迹佳美传你名。 
3 得我声音来歌唱， 
 荣耀天上的君王； 
 得我嘴唇作用器， 
 前来述说你信息。 
 前来述说你信息。 
4 得我金银和所有， 
 不敢分毫有私留； 
 得我聪明并才干， 
 前来作成你心欢。 
 前来作成你心欢。 
5 得我意志永属你， 
 从今不再为自己； 
 得我心作你宝座， 
 你住我里号令我。 
 你住我里号令我。 
6 得我爱情，哦，我主，  只在你前才倾吐； 
 得我全人，灵、魂、体，  直到永远都为你。 
 直到永远都为你。 
427 TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE
1 Take my life, and let it be 
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee; 
 Take my moments and my days, 
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise. 
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise. 
2 Take my hands, and let them move  At the impulse of Thy love; 
 Take my feet and let them be 
 Swift and beautiful for Thee. 
 Swift and beautiful for Thee. 
3 Take my voice, and let me sing 
 Always, only, for ‘my King; 
 Take my lips, and let them be 
 Filled with messages from Thee. 
 Filled with messages from Thee. 
4 Take my silver and my gold; 
 Not a mite would I withhold; 
 Take my intellect, and use 
 Every power as Thou shalt choose.  Every power as Thou shalt choose. 
5 Take my will, and make it Thine; 
 It shall be no longer mine. 
 Take my heart; it is Thine own; 
 It shall be Thy royal throne. 
 It shall be Thy royal throne. 
6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour 
 At Thy feet its treasure-store. 
 Take myself, and I will be 
 Ever, only, all for Thee. 
 Ever, only, all for Thee.
428 主你曾为我受死
1 主，你曾为我受死，  我当献何给你？
 是否稍许保留我所持，  或将全部献给你？ 
和 耶稣我主，我救主，  为我，你舍一切； 
 你曾为我离天府， 
 并且死在加略。 
 耶稣我主，我救主，  为我，你舍一切； 
 我心岂可私自留一部？  向你，我献一切！ 
2 主，你已将我救赎，  我当献何给你？ 
 所献虽小却是我全部 -   降服归你来管理。 
3 主，你仍赐恩眷顾，  我当将何给你？ 
 无论时光、恩赐与财富，  不再保留全归你。 
428 WHAT SHALL I GIVE THEE MASTER IRREGULAR METER
1 What shall I give Thee, Master? 
 Thou who didst die for me. 
 Shall I give less of what I possess, 
 Or shall I give all to Thee? 
(C) Jesus, my Lord and Savior; 
 Thou hast giv’n all for me; 
 Thou didst leave Thy home above 
 To die on Calvary. 
 What shall I give Thee, Master? 
 Thou hast giv’n all for me; 
 Not just a part or half of my heart, 
 I will give all to Thee. 
2 What shall I give Thee, Master? 
 Thou hast redeemed my soul; 
 My gift is small but it is my all —  
 Surrendered to Thy control, 
3 What shall I give Thee, Master? 
 Giver of gifts divine! 
 I Will not hold time, talents or gold —  
 For everything shall be Thine.
429 照你企图主
1 照你企图，主， 
 照你企图，因你是陶人，  我是泥土： 
 塑造又甄陶，照你美意；  降服且等候，使我归依。 
2 照你企图，主，照你企图，  我在你面前谦卑俯伏：  鉴察又试炼，显我真情；  修理且洗涤，使我纯净。 
3 照你企图，主，照你企图，  完全脱自己，是我所慕：  破碎又剥夺，使我成零；  挖透且倒空，使我无剩。 
4 照你企图，主，照你企图，  深愿我全人向你降服：  圣灵充满我，流露你命；  基督活于我，彰显你形。 
429 HAVE THINE OWN WAY LORD
1 Have Thine own way, Lord, 
 Have Thine own way; Thou art the Potter,  I am the clay. 
 Mould me and make me After Thy will,  While I am waiting, Yielded and still. 
2 Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;  Search me and try me, Master, today. 
 Whiter than snow, Lord, Wash me just now,  As in Thy presence Humbly I bow. 
3 Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;  Wounded and weary, Help me, I pray.  Power, all power, Surely is Thine, 
 Touch me and heal me, Savior divine. 
4 Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;  Hold o’er my being Absolute sway. 
 Fill with Thy Spirit Till all shall see 
 Christ only, always, Living in me.
430 勿对我谈属地享乐
1 勿对我谈属地享乐， 
 勿用鄙利引诱我； 
 勿愚我以地上幻影， 
 勿用虚荣烦扰我。 
 我已弃绝化装偶像， 
 今后不再属自己； 
 我已将心献给基督， 
 我只属祂无别依。 
和 我不属自己，我不属自己，  我今属于基督，不再属于自己。 
2 哦，只属于我主基督， 
 带来何等的安息！ 
 当我所有全都不留， 
 祂丰盛我能倚。 
 荣耀恩主，将我接收， 
 使我完全属于你， 
 适合享受你作我分， 
 当我喜欢成你的。 
3 疲倦人哪，放弃挣扎， 
 永勿再属你自己； 
 将你自己全给基督， 
 全然属祂无所遗。 
 祂曾舍己为要得你， 
 今来要你全归祂； 
 凡祂所有都已给你， 
 你就不该不给祂。 
430 TELL ME NOT OF EARTHLY PLEASURES
1 Tell me not of earthly pleasures, 
 Tempt me not with sordid gain; 
 Mock me not with earth’s illusions, 
 Vex me not with honors vain. 
 I am weaned from sinful idols; 
 I am henceforth not my own; 
 I have given my heart to Jesus, 
 I belong to Him alone. 
(C) I am not my own, I am not my own. 
 I belong to Jesus, And I am not my own. 
2 Oh, the blessed rest it brings us 
 To belong to Christ alone; 
 We can draw on all His fulness 
 When we’ve nothing of our own. 
 Blessed Jesus, take me, own me, 
 Make me, keep me wholly Thine. 
 Deign to find in me Thy portion, 
 While I joy to call Thee mine. 
3 Weary soul, give up the struggle, 
 Cease at length thyself to own; 
 Give yourself away to Jesus, 
 And belong to Him alone. 
 Once He gave His all to win thee, 
 Now He asks as much of thee; 
 All He has He fully gives thee; 
 Let thy love His portion be.
431 当这世界已变迁
1 当这世界已变迁， 
 当这炎日不再升， 
 当我站立在主前， 
 回顾今生的历程； 
 主，那时我才知道，  我亏欠你有多少。 
2 当我站立在座前， 
 穿上美丽的白衣； 
 当我得识你完全， 
 能以全心来爱你； 
 主，那时我才知道，  我亏欠你有多少。 
3 虽今有如对镜看， 
 将你荣耀看不清； 
 使我仍觉恩甘甜 -  
 以你圣灵来显明： 
 现在就让我知道， 
 我亏欠你有多少。 
431 WHEN THIS PASSING WORLD IS DONE
1 When this passing world is done, 
 When has sunk yon glaring sun, 
 When we stand with Christ on high, 
 Looking o’er life’s history; 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
 Not till then, how much I owe. 
2 When I stand before the throne 
 Dressed in beauty not my own, 
 When I see Thee as Thou art, 
 Love Thee with unsinning heart; 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
 Not till then, how much I owe. 
3 E’en on earth, as through a glass 
 Darkly, let Thy glory pass; 
 Make forgiveness feel so sweet; 
 Make Thy Spirit,s help so meet: 
 E’en on earth, Lord, make me know 
 Something of how much I owe.
432 不再固执我向你投依
1 不再固执，我向你投依；  主，我属你，单单属你；  我今向你倾吐我心意：  “愿你成就所定旨意。” 
和 紧拥抱我！神甘美旨意！  直到完全消失于你！  紧拥抱我！神甘美旨意！  直到完全消失于你！ 
2 罪污路上已厌倦失望，  黑暗笼罩使我心慌；  光明已现，今使我欢畅，  我在你里寻得太阳！ 
3 得胜的主，你宝贝旨意，  现在将我拥抱、管制；  纷扰消失，平安何满溢，  我心有如困鸟获释！ 
4 封闭于你，与你永相依，  流荡脚踪不再游移；  无何能使我与你相离，  我要永住你美旨里。 
432 MY STUBBORN WILL AT LAST HATH  YIELDED
9.8.9.8. WITH CHORUS 
Consecrating to the Lord 
1 My stubborn will at last hath yielded; 
 I would be Thine, and Thine alone, 
 And this the prayer my lips are bringing, 
 “Lord, let in me Thy will be done.” 
(C) Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, 
 Till I am wholly lost in Thee; 
 Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, 
 Till I am wholly lost in Thee. 
2 I’m tired of sin, footsore and weary, 
 The darksome path hath dreary grown, 
 But now a light has ris’n to cheer me; 
 I find in Thee my Star, my Sun. 
3 Thy precious Will, O conqu’ring Savior, 
 Doth now embrace and compass me; 
 All discords hushed, my peace a river, 
 My soul a prisoned bird set free. 
4 Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever, 
 My wayward feet no more to roam; 
 What pow’r from Thee my soul can sever? 
 The center of God’s will my home.
433 都归基督都归基督
1 都归基督，都归基督， 
 都归基督理当然； 
 我既是主宝血所赎， 
 主就当得所有权。 
 都归基督，都归基督，每时每日归基督；  都归基督，都归基督，每时每日归基督； 
2 愿我双手归主使用， 
 愿我两脚跟主行， 
 愿我双目瞻主圣容， 
 愿我两唇颂主名。 
 都归基督，都归基督，愿我两唇颂主名。  都归基督，都归基督，愿我两唇颂主名。 
3 世人贪爱虚荣、美色， 
 追求属地的事物； 
 夸耀财富、名声、享乐； 
 我却单单靠基督。 
 都归基督，都归基督，我要单单靠基督。  都归基督，都归基督，我要单单靠基督。 
4 自从我眼注视基督， 
 所有事物全变色； 
 一望主在十架受苦， 
 我就甘愿负主轭。 
 都归基督，都归基督，我心甘愿负主轭。  都归基督，都归基督，我心甘愿负主轭。 
5 奇妙恩典，深高阔长！ 
 我口歌颂，心感戴； 
 荣耀救主，王中之王， 
 竟然看我可宝爱！ 
 都归基督，都归基督，我口歌颂心感戴。  都归基督，都归基督，我口歌颂心感戴。 (“基督”可唱作”耶稣”)  
433 ALL FOR JESUS ALL FOR JESUS
1 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! 
 All my being’s ransomed pow’rs; 
 All my thoughts and words and doings, 
 All my days and all my hours. 
 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! All my days and all my hours.  All for Jesus! All for Jesus! All my days and all my hours. 
2 Let my hands perform His bidding; 
 Let my feet run in His ways; 
 Let mine eyes see Jesus only; 
 Let my lips speak forth His praise. 
 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Let my lips speak forth His praise.  All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Let my lips speak forth His praise. 
3 Worldlings prize their gems of beauty, 
 Cling to gilded toys of dust; 
 Boast of wealth, and fame, and pleasure; 
 Only Jesus will I trust. 
 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Only Jesus will I trust.  All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Only Jesus will I trust. 
4 Since mine eyes were fixed on Jesus, 
 I’ve lost sight of all beside —  
 So enchained my spirit’s vision, 
 Looking at the Crucified. 
 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Looking at the Crucified.  All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Looking at the Crucified. 
5 Oh, what wonder! how amazing! 
 Jesus, glorious King of kings, 
 Deigns to call me His beloved, 
 Lets me rest beneath His wings. 
 All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Resting now beneath His wings.  All for Jesus! All for Jesus! Resting now beneath His wings.
434 绝对分别出来归于主圣灵
1 绝对分别出来，归于主圣灵！  不惜任何代价，寻求祂丰盛；  割断所有岸索，开到水深处；  靠着祂的大能，刚强而坚固。
和 绝对分别出来，归于万有主，  答应祂的呼召，寻求祂丰富。 
2 绝对分别出来，归于主圣灵！  沉没还要沉没，直到己去净！  直到器皿倒空，祂脚前破碎；  等候直到充满，流出主恩惠。 
3 绝对分别出来，归于神旨意！  走主所走道路，靠着祂恩力；  撇弃安逸、享乐，随主向前进；  等候祂的引导，静听祂声音。 
4 绝对分别出来，一直到永世；  不要我的心意，乃要祂意旨；  我的计划、愿望，在祂全灭没；  似乎一无所有，万有实属我。 
5 绝对分别出来，何等的甜美，  作祂爱的俘虏，自由何宝贵；  脱离罪的辖制、疑惑与恐惧，  脱离所有重担、忧愁和挂虑。 
6 绝对分别出来，何等的安息，  在祂面前等候，照祂的心意；  等候得着充满，满有祂圣灵，  将我里面各部完全都炼净。 
7 祂灵将我充满，带着祂同在！  在祂我蒙祝福，在祂我蒙爱！  今后里面亮光永不再变暗，  如此向祂活着，分别到永远。 
434 UTTERLY ABANDONED TO THE HOLY  GHOST
6.5.6.5.D. WITH CHORUS 
Consecrating to the Lord 
1 Utterly abandoned To the Holy Ghost! 
 Seeking all His fulness At whatever cost; 
 Cutting all the shorelines, Launching in the deep  Of His mighty power, Strong to save and keep. 
(C) Utterly abandoned To the Lord of all, 
 Seeking all His fulness, Answ’ring His dear call. 
2 Utterly abandoned To the Holy Ghost! 
 Oh! the sinking, sinking, Till the self is lost! 
 Till the vessel’s emptied Broken at His feet; 
 Waiting till His filling Makes the work complete. 
3 Utterly abandoned To the will of God; 
 Walking in the pathway That my Master trod;  Leaving ease and pleasure; Making Him my’choice,  Waiting for His guidance, Listening for His voice. 
4 Utterly abandoned! Through eternity; 
 My will never choosing, His it e’er shall be; 
 All my plans and longings Lost in His sweet will,  Having nothing, owning All things in Him still. 
5 Utterly abandoned! ‘Tis so sweet to be 
 Captive in His love-bonds, Yet so wondrous free;  Free from sin’s dominion, Free from doubt and fear,  Free from every worry, Burden, grief or care. 
6 Utterly abandoned! Oh, the rest is sweet, 
 Waiting in His presence At His blessed feet;  Waiting for the filling Of the Host divine, 
 Who my inward parts shall Perfectly refine. 
7 Lo! His Spirit fills me, With His presence sweet!  I, in Him, am blessed! I, in Him, complete! 
 Now the light within me Never shall grow dim  While abandoned ever, Living unto Him!

435 求主把我捆绑
1 求主把我捆绑，
 我才得着释放； 
 愿主迫我向主缴械，  我才得胜奏捷； 
 当我倚靠自己， 
 我就失败危亟； 
 当主膀臂将我围困，  我手就更有劲。 
2 我心未交主时， 
 真是软弱愚痴， 
 自己所愿自己不行，  万事漂流无定； 
 主若未加锁炼， 
 就难自由进前， 
 求主慈爱将它奴隶，  它才会得能力。 
3 我的生命未死， 
 终身总是丧失： 
 胜少败多，实无能力，  时为肉体叹息。 
 我若没有死过， 
 我就难以活着， 
 求主使我脱离自己，  才会完全得你。 
4 我今认识了你， 
 也略知道自己， 
 所以今后真不愿意 
 再藉天然能力。 
 求主永远的灵， 
 使我生命全钉， 
 使我治死肉体行为，  主兴盛，我衰微。 
435 MAKE ME A CAPTIVE LORD
1 Make me a captive, Lord, 
 And then I shall be free; 
 Force me to render up my sword,  And I shall conq’ror be. 
 I sink in life’s alarms 
 When by myself I stand, 
 Imprison me within Thine arms,  And strong shall be my hand. 
2 My heart is weak and poor 
 Until it master find: 
 It has no spring of action sure, 
 It varies with the wind; 
 It cannot freely move 
 Till Thou hast wrought its chain;  Enslave it with Thy matchless love,  And deathless it shall reign. 
3 My power is faint and low 
 Till I have learned to serve: 
 It wants the needed fire to glow,  It wants the breeze to nerve; 
 It cannot drive the world 
 Until itself be driven; 
 Its flag can only be unfurled 
 When Thou shalt breathe from heaven. 
4 My will is not my own 
 Till Thou hast made it Thine; 
 If it would reach the monarch’s throne  It must its crown resign; 
 It only stands unbent 
 Amid the clashing strife, 
 When on Thy bosom it has leant,  And found in Thee its life.

436 我已转身背向俗世
1 我已转身背向俗世，
 和它一切的欢娱； 
 我已心向更美的事， 
 就是天上的储蓄； 
 一切虚荣、一切扬显，  不能使我再逗留； 
 我已越过分别界线， 
 世界已丢在背后。 
和 远远丢背后， 
 远远丢背后， 
 我已越过分别界线，  世界已丢在背后。 
2 我已脱离罪的生活， 
 弃绝所有的愚行； 
 我今主里生活、动作，  只愿听祂的命令； 
 我已靠主出死入生， 
 十架已将我拯救； 
 我愿为祂舍去名声， 
 世界已丢在背后。 
和 远远丢背后， 
 远远丢背后， 
 就愿为祂舍去所有，  世界已丢在背后。 
3 我今永远不再回到 
 旧日愚昧的地位； 
 惟独在此才有恩召， 
 完全安息、不定罪； 
 我今已经更换主人， 
 对祂我要永伺候； 
 我今在此永弃红尘， 
 世界已丢在背后。 
和 远远丢背后， 
 远远丢背后， 
 地的捆绑就此脱尽，  世界已丢在背后。 
4 我的前途，一定永定，  我并不要别救主； 
 我也不求更好福音， 
 过于祂赐的宽恕； 
 我心已经决定事神， 
 无论如何不回头； 
 已往一切实为可恨， 
 世界已丢在背后。 
和 远远丢背后， 
 远远丢背后， 
 已往一切实为可恨，  世界已丢在背后。 
436 I’VE TURNED MY BACK UPON THE WORLD
1 I’ve turned my back upon the world 
 With all its idle pleasures, 
 And set my heart on better things, 
 On higher, holier treasures; 
 No more its glitter and its glare, 
 And vanity shall blind me; 
 I’ve crossed the separating line, 
 And left the world behind me. 
(C) Far, far behind me! 
 Far, far behind me! 
 I’ve crossed the separating line, 
 And left the world behind me. 
2 I’ve left the old sad life of sin, 
 Its follies all forsaken; 
 My standing place is now in Christ, 
 His holy vows I’ve taken; 
 Beneath the standard of the cross 
 The world henceforth shall find me; 
 I’ve passed in Christ from death to life, 
 And left the world behind me. 
(C) Far, far behind me! 
 Far, far behind me! 
 I’ve passed in Christ from death to life, 
 And left the world behind me. 
3 My soul shall ne’er return again 
 Back to its former station, 
 For here alone is perfect peace, 
 And rest from condemnation; 
 I’ve made exchange of masters now, 
 The vows of glory bind me, 
 And once for all I’ve left the world, 
 Yes, left the world behind me. 
(C) Far, far behind me! 
 Far, far behind me! 
 And once for all I’ve left the world, 
 Yes, left the world behind me. 
4 My choice is made forevermore, 
 I want no other Savior; 
 I ask no purer happiness 
 Than His sweet love and favor; 
 My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ, 
 No more the world shall blind me; 
 I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death, 
 And left the world behind me. 
(C) Far, far behind me! 
 Far,’ far behind me! 
 I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death, 
 And left the world behind me.
437 我今愿跟随救主不论走何路 特.和.
1 我今愿跟随救主，不论走何路：  或是平坦大路，或是崎岖窄途；  既有救主亲自相辅，我就不踌躇，  一路跟随耶稣，直到进国度。 
和 跟随！跟随！我愿跟随耶稣！  不论福，不论苦，我必跟随主！  跟随！跟随！我愿跟随耶稣！  不论领我何处，我必跟随主！ 
2 我今愿跟随救主，不论在何处：  或在明媚乐土，或在死荫幽谷；  既有救主亲自照护，我就不感苦；  处处跟随耶稣，直到末一步。 
3 我今愿跟随救主，不论时何如：  或是阳光满目，或是黑云密布；  既有救主亲自部署，我就无所顾；  时时跟随耶稣，一直到天曙。 
437 DOWN IN THE VALLEY WITH MY SAVIOR I  WOULD GO
1 IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
Consecrating to the Lord 
1 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, 
 Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;  Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,  Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won. 
(C) Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus! 
 Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on! 
 Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus! 
 Everywhere He leads me I would follow on! 
2 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, 
 Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;  With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear, 
 Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near. 
3 Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep, 
 Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep; 
 He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod, 
 Up to where they gather in the rest of God.
438 我当如何爱我的主
1 我当如何爱我的主？  如何奉献使祂欢喜？  不稍离开祂的道路，  学习如何与祂亲密？ 
2 难道这是奉献道路？
3 我的途径若是痛苦，  主，我求你，禁我退缩，  使我仍然向你顺服，  追忆你的十架重负。 
4 让我思念，你曾如何  离开许多纯洁乐事，  来忧、来饿、来倦、来渴，  无家之夜，不息之日。 
5 为我来忧、来倦、来死，  你来不求自己喜悦；  地上安逸虽难推辞，  我岂爱你不胜这些？ 
6 是的，我算万事为损，  为要来得你的注意；  丢弃万事虽如土粪，  为着爱你有何可惜？  (英诗无第六节)  
438 HOW SHALL I FOLLOW HIM I SERVE
1 How shall I follow Him I serve? 
 How shall I copy Him I love? 
 Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve, 
 Which lead me to His seat above? 
2 Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn, 
 The life of toil, the mean abode, 
 The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn —  
 Are these the consecrated road? 
3 Lord, should my path through suff’ring lie,  Forbid it I should e’er repine; 
 Still let me turn to Calvary, 
 Nor heed my griefs, rememb’ring Thine. 
4 O let me think how Thou didst leave 
 Untasted every pure delight, 
 To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve, 
 The toilsome day, the homeless night: 
5 To faint, to grieve, to die for me! 
 Thou camest, not Thyself to please; 
 And, dear as earthly comforts be, 
 Shall I not love Thee more than these? 
6 (No English translation)
439 活着为耶稣只望能单纯
1 活着为耶稣，只望能单纯，  所有的一切都求祂喜悦，  自动并乐意来向祂投顺，  这是我蒙神赐福的秘诀。 
和 耶稣我主，我救主，  我将自己给你， 
 因你为我代死时， 
 给的是你自己； 
 从此，我无别的主，  我心是你宝座， 
 我的一生一世，基督，  只要为你生活。 
2 活着为耶稣，祂为我缘故，  在十字架上担当罪与羞，  这爱激励我答应祂招呼，  恭敬向着祂奉献我所有。 
3 活着为耶稣，无论在何处，  我为祂缘故，作成祂事务，  甘愿来承受损失或痛苦，  看每个试炼是十架一部。 
4 活着为耶稣，时间已短促，  祂的笑脸是我宝贵秘密，  寻找失丧者，祂死所救赎，  带领疲倦者，享受祂安息。 
439 LIVING FOR JESUS A LIFE THAT IS TRUE
1 Living for Jesus a life that is true, 
 Striving to please Him in all that I do; 
 Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free, 
 This is the pathway of blessing for me. 
(C) O Jesus, Lord and Savior, 
 I give myself to Thee, 
 For Thou, in Thy atonement, 
 Didst give Thyself for me; 
 I own no other Master, 
 My heart shall be Thy throne, 
 My life I give, henceforth to live, 
 O Christ, for Thee alone. 
2 Living for Jesus who died in my place, 
 Bearing on Calv’ry my sin and disgrace; 
 Such love constrains me to answer His call, 
 Follow His leading and give Him my all. 
3 Living for Jesus wherever I am, 
 Doing each duty in His holy name; 
 Willing to suffer affliction and loss, 
 Deeming each trial a part of my cross. 
4 Living for Jesus through earth’s little while, 
 My dearest treasure, the light of His smile; 
 Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem, 
 Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
440 我的荣耀得胜君王
1 我的荣耀、得胜君王，  我举双手降服于你；  我的意志向你投降，  作你座前快乐奴隶。 
2 我主，领我到你门口，  我耳甘愿被你穿透；  你的捆索是真自由；  服你、事你，没有怨尤。 
3 思想、意志、我耳、我手，  都归你作爱的奴役！  甘愿舍弃我的自由，  服你脚下，永不背离。 
4 在你脚下；我才知晓  你的恩赐溢我双手；  被穿耳朵方始听到 
 细语告我：”我归你有。”  
440 MY GLORIOUS VICTOR PRINCE DIVINE
1 My glorious Victor, Prince Divine, 
 Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
 At length my will is all Thine own, 
 Glad vassal of a Savior’s throne. 
2 My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
 Pierce this now willing ear once more; 
 Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
 With Thee, to toil, endure, obey. 
3 Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will, 
 Use all in Thy dear slav’ry still! 
 Self’s weary liberties I cast 
 Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast. 
4 Tread them still down; and then I know, 
 These hands shall with Thy gifts o’erfiow; 
 And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
 Which tells me Thou and I are one.
441 我今撇下一切事物
1 我今撇下一切事物，  背十架跟耶稣； 
 甘受藐视、厌弃、贫苦，  一心跟主走窄路。 
 前我所爱、所慕、所求，  今与雄心同归尽； 
 但我又是何等丰优，  神与基督是我分。 
2 让这世界弃我、嫌我，  恩主也曾被弃嫌； 
 人面、人心，欺我、骗我，  惟你永远不欺骗。 
 当你向我显出笑脸，  友虽生疏敌虽险， 
 但我心安，处之泰然，  因我得见你欢颜。 
3 人虽逼我使我苦痛，  不过驱我到你前； 
 世间苦难压我愈重，  天上平安愈甘甜。 
 有何忧苦能将我袭，  当你赐我你爱怜。 
 有何快乐能将我迷，  若你不在它里面。 
4 向前！由恩进入荣耀，  信当藤牌，求当翼；  永世日子就要破晓，  主必领我直到底。 
 地上职事就要停止，  作客旅程就要完， 
 盼望就要变成事实，  信变眼见，求变赞。 
441 JESUS I MY CROSS HAVE TAKEN
1 Jesus, I my cross have taken, 
 All to leave and follow Thee; 
 Destitute, despised, forsaken, 
 Thou, from hence, my all shalt be. 
 Perish every fond ambition, 
 All I’ve sought, and hoped, and known;  Yet how rich is my condition, 
 God and Christ are still my own! 
2 Let the world despise and leave me, 
 They have left my Savior, too; 
 Human hearts and looks deceive me; 
 Thou art not, like man, untrue; 
 And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,  God of wisdom, love, and might, 
 Foes may hate, and friends disown me;  Show Thy face, and all is bright. 
3 Man may trouble and distress me, 
 ‘Twill but drive me to Thy breast; 
 Life with trials hard may press me, 
 Christ will bring me sweeter rest. 
 O ‘tis not in grief to harm me, 
 While Thy love is left to me; 
 O ‘twere not in joy to charm me, 
 Were that joy unmixed with Thee. 
4 Haste thee on from grace to glory, 
 Armed by faith and winged by prayer;  God’s eternal day’s before thee, 
 God’s own hand shall guide thee there.  Soon shall close thy earthly mission, 
 Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days, 
 Hope shall change to glad fruition, 
 Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
442 我今已定意跟随主耶稣
1 我今已定意跟随主耶稣，  我今已定意跟随主耶稣，  我今已定意跟随主耶稣，  不再回头，不再回头。 
2 我面向十架，世界丢背后，  我面向十架，世界丢背后；  我面向十架，世界丢背后；  不再回头，不再回头。 
3 即使无别人，我仍要跟随；  即使无别人，我仍要跟随；  即使无别人，我仍要跟随；  不再回头，不再回头。 
4 有主引领我，我当然跟随；  有主引领我，我当然跟随；  有主引领我，我当然跟随；  不再回头，不再回头。 
5 唱荣耀、荣耀，唱阿利路亚；  唱荣耀、荣耀，唱阿利路亚；  唱荣耀、荣耀，唱，阿利路亚；  不再回头，不再回头。 
442 I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW JESUS
1 I have decided to follow Jesus, 
 I have decided to follow Jesus, 
 I have decided to follow Jesus, 
 No turning back, no turning back. 
2 The world behind me, the cross before me, 
 The world behind me, the cross before me, 
 The world behind me, the cross before me, 
 No turning back, no turning back. 
3 Though none go with me, still I will follow.  Though none go with me, still I will follow.  Though none go with me, still I will follow,  No turning back, no turning back. 
4 Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow. 
 Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow. 
 Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow, 
 No turning back, no turning back. 
5 Sing glory, glory and hallelujah. 
 Sing glory, glory and hallelujah. 
 Sing glory, glory and hallelujah, 
 No turning back, no turning back.
443 当人弃绝地的贿赂
1 当人弃绝地的贿赂，  前来为神而活，
 他的所得无限富有，  口舌难以述说， 
 因为万有全是他的，  生、死，或是事、物；  基督是他生命、呼吸，  也是他的住处。 
2 像我这人，王肯选上，  有分祂的宝座， 
 而我竟然不肯应选，  这是何其奇特！ 
 永远勿说这是牺牲！  无论代价若干， 
 只要能入加略圣军，  乃是难言特权。 
3 起来！将这交易算看：  零碎换来整个 -  
 万事、万物、加上万人，  竟都归你得着。 
 当你属祂，万有属你，  并且祂你合一； 
 你还得享无限生命，  权益有何能比！ 
443 NO MORTAL TONGUE CAN E’ER DESCRIBE
1 No mortal tongue can e’er describe 
 The freedom of the soul, 
 When passed beyond all earthly bribe 
 To God’s complete control. 
 All things are his, yes, life, and death, 
 Things present or to come; 
 In Christ he draws in peace each breath, 
 In Christ he finds his home. 
2 When such as we the King can choose, 
 To share with Him His throne, 
 ‘Tis passing strange that we refuse 
 To be our Lord’s alone. 
 O never speak of sacrifice! 
 A privilege untold 
 Is to be His at any price, 
 In Calv’ry’s hosts enrolled. 
3 Arise! the holy bargain strike —  
 The fragment for the whole —  
 All men and all events alike 
 Must serve the ransomed soul. 
 All things are yours when you are His, 
 And He and you are one; 
 A boundless life in Him there is, 
 Whence doubt and fear are gone. 
444 众人涌进主的国度
1 众人涌进主的国度，  十架少人负；
 众人争夺主的赏赐，  世界有谁辞？ 
 人虽无心走主道路，  仍想主祝福！ 
 人虽无心走主道路，  仍想主祝福！ 
2 多人都贪享主甘旨，  少有愿禁食！ 
 多人都喜登主宝座，  少有愿飘泊！ 
 同祂唱诗虽然有人，  儆醒却不能。 
 同祂唱诗虽然有人，  儆醒却不能。 
3 众人都想同主高贵，  卑贱却都畏。 
 当主凡事为他豫备，  就大声赞美； 
 当主稍微求他一点，  就立发怨言。 
 当主稍微求他一点，  就立发怨言。 
4 但那诚实爱主的人，  祸福都不问， 
 就是他们宝贵心血，  也愿为主舍； 
 求主给我这样心志，  赤忠忘生死。 
 求主给我这样心志，  赤忠忘生死。 
444 MANY CROWD THE SAVIOR’S KINGDOM
1 Many crowd the Savior’s kingdom, 
 Few receive His cross;  
 Many seek His consolation, 
 Few will suffer loss. 
 For the dear sake of the Master, 
 Counting all but dross, 
 For the dear sake of the Master, 
 Counting all but dross. 
2 Many sitat Jesus’ table, 
 Few will fast with Him, 
 When the sorrow-cup of anguish 
 Trembles to the brim. 
 Few watch with Him in the garden, 
 Who have sung the hymn, 
 Few watch with Him in the garden, 
 Who have sung the hymn. 
3 Many will confess His wisdom, 
 Few embrace His shame. 
 Many, should He smile upon them, 
 Will His praise proclaim; 
 Then, if for a while He leave them, 
 They desert His name, 
 Then, if for a while He leave them, 
 They desert His name. 
4 But the souls who love Him truly, 
 Let woe come or bliss, 
 These will count their dearest hearts’ blood 
 Not their own, but His. 
 Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me, 
 Give me love like this, 
 Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me, 
 Give me love like this.
445 我是否要背负十架
1 我是否要背负十架，  跟从神的羔羊？
 我岂可以怕出代价，  要得世界原谅？ 
和 因你名，宝贵的名，  因你为我舍命， 
 靠恩，无论如何艰难，  我要求你喜欢。 
2 别人苦战要得荣耀，  血汗满被沙场； 
 我岂可以安坐花轿，  被抬直到天上？ 
3 难道我无仇敌当拒？  我无破口当堵？ 
 难道俗世也可相与？  也可作我帮助？ 
4 我要掌权，就得争战，  哦主，加我力量；  我愿受辱，我不畏难，  靠你话语刚强。 
445 AM I A SOLDIER OF THE CROSS
1 Am I a soldier of the Cross —  
 A follower of the Lamb? 
 And shall I fear to own His cause, 
 Or blush to speak His name? 
(C) In the name, the precious name, 
 Of Him who died for me, 
 Through grace I’ll win the promised crown,  Whate’er my cross may be. 
2 Must I be carried to the skies 
 On flowery beds of ease, 
 While others fought to win the prize 
 And sailed through bloody seas? 
3 Are there no foes for me to face? 
 Must I not stem the flood? 
 Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
 To help me on to God? 
4 Since I must fight if I would reign, 
 Increase my courage, Lord! 
 I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
 Supported by Thy Word.
446 谁是在主这边
1 谁是在主这边？
 谁要事奉王？ 
 谁要作祂助手， 
 去为祂救亡？ 
 谁要撇开世界， 
 去为主争战？ 
 谁是在主这边， 
 跟随主向前？ 
和 借着你的救赎， 
 并藉你恩典， 
 可爱、荣耀救主，  我在你这边。 
2 参加主的军队， 
 欢乐去争战， 
 不是为着荣耀， 
 不是为冠冕； 
 乃是因着主爱 
 激励我向前； 
 我既蒙祂恩待， 
 该在祂这边。 
3 你已将我救赎， 
 作你的子民， 
 乃是用你宝血， 
 不是用金银； 
 凡来跟从你者， 
 得福都无限； 
 你使我们甘愿 
 且自由向前。 
4 战争虽会凶猛， 
 仇敌也强悍； 
 但是主的军队， 
 无人能击散。 
 在祂大纛之下， 
 必定能得胜， 
 因祂真实、不变， 
 奏凯已确定。 
5 蒙主选为兵丁， 
 在今世争战， 
 我当完全忠心， 
 随元帅向前； 
 如此服事我王， 
 切勿变冷淡， 
 守住高贵身份， 
 忠贞又勇敢。 
446 WHO IS ON THE LORD’S SIDE
1 Who is on the Lord’s side? 
 Who will serve the King? 
 Who will be His helpers, 
 Other lives to bring? 
 Who will leave the world’s side? 
 Who will face the foe? 
 Who is on the Lord’s side? 
 Who for Him will go? 
(C) By Thy grand redemption, 
 By Thy grace divine, 
 We are on the Lord’s side; 
 Savior, we are Thine. 
2 Not for weight of glory, 
 Not for crown and palm, 
 Enter we the army, 
 Raise the warrior psalm; 
 But for love that claimeth 
 Lives for whom He died; 
 He whom Jesus nameth 
 Must be on His side. 
3 Jesus, Thou hast bought us, 
 Not with gold or gem, 
 But with Thine own life-blood, 
 For Thy diadem; 
 With Thy blessing filling 
 Each who comes to Thee, 
 Thou hast made us willing, 
 Thou hast made us free. 
4 Fierce may. be the conflict, 
 Strong may be the foe, 
 But the King’s own army 
 None can overthrow. 
 Round His standard ranging 
 Victory is secure, 
 For His truth unchanging 
 Makes the triumph sure. 
5 Chosen to be soldiers 
 In an alien land: 
 Chosen, called, and faithful, 
 For our Captain’s band; 
 In the service royal 
 Let us not grow cold; 
 Let us be right loyal,  
 Noble, true, and bold.
447 与你合一恩主耶稣
1 与你合一，恩主耶稣，  与你合一在灵里；  凡你所是都活我里，  我今得享你自己。 
和 合为一，合为一，  我与你合为一；  你的丰富是我供给，  我的一切全是你。 
2 今享你的属人生命，  丰满有你的人性，  所有你的完全顺从，  都能用于我人生。 
3 与你合一，在十架上，  在你里面我已死；  我向世界已经死了，  世界向我也如此。 
4 在我里面供应我。
5 与你合一，在升天里，  现今同你坐天上；  在这地上乃是旅客，  我的真命在你藏。 
6 与你合一，在宝座上，  有分于你的权柄，  如同有分于你生命，  同一性情，同一灵。 
447 I AM ONE WITH THEE LORD JESUS
1 I am one with Thee, Lord Jesus,  
 One in spirit now with Thee; 
 All Thyself I now possess, Lord, 
 All Thou art now lives in me. 
(C) One with Thee, one with Thee, 
 One with Thee, one with Thee; 
 Day by day I share Thy riches, 
 Thou art everything to me. 
2 Now I share Thy human life, Lord, 
 Filled with Thy humanity, 
 All of Thy complete obedience 
 Is available to me. 
3 One with Thee in crucifixion, 
 On the cross I died in Thee; 
 I am dead unto the world, Lord, 
 And the world is dead to me. 
4 One with Thee in resurrection, 
 Risen now to live in Thee, 
 With that life which is Thyself, Lord, 
 Now in me, Lord, even me. 
5 One with Thee in Thine ascension, 
 In the heavens now with Thee; 
 Here a pilgrim and a stranger, 
 My true life is hid in Thee. 
6 One with Thee in Thine enthronement, 
 Sharing Thine authority, 
 Even as I share Thy life, Lord, 
 I in Thee and Thou in me.
