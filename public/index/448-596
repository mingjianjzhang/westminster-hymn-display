449 与基督同死祂死算我死
1 与基督同死，祂死算我死；  与基督同起，我有祂生命；  与基督同升，我超过此世；  主，时时刻刻，我归于你名。

449 DYING WITH JESUS BY DEATH RECKONED  MINE
10.10.10.10. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine; 
 Living with Jesus a new life divine; 
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine, 
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine. 
(C) Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, 
 Moment by moment I’ve life from above; 
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; 
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine. 
2 Never a battle with wrong for the right, 
 Never a contest that He doth not fight; 
 Lifting above us His banner so white; 
 Moment by moment I’m kept in His sight. 
3 Never a trial that He is not there, 
 Never a burden that He doth not bear; 
 Never a sorrow that He doth not share, 
 Moment by moment, I’m under His care. 
4 Never a heartache, and never a groan, 
 Never a teardrop, and never a moan; 
 Never a danger but there on the throne 
 Moment by moment He thinks of His own. 
5 Never a weakness that He doth not feel, 
 Never a sickness that He cannot heal; 
 Moment by moment, in woe or in weal, 
 Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
450 与主同葬也一同复活
1 与主同葬，也一同复活，  还有什么留给我去作？  只要我不再奋斗击空，  只要我照新生而举动。  荣耀归于神！ 
2 与主我的元首同复活，  我今在圣洁路上走着；  当我向前时，我就想到：  “死的人脱罪”是何其好！  荣耀归于神！ 
3 与主同活，祂永不再死；  与主同行，祂永不会迟；  我天天算自己已经死，  所以我就从捆绑得释。  荣耀归于神！ 
4 为主活着，我献上肢体，  永远归神，作祂的奴隶。  我今在恩下，不在法下，  罪已失势，主代兴管辖。  荣耀归于神！ 
5 靠主长大，我今真惭愧  再题到我已往的宝贵；  我愿意结出成圣果子， 
 满足神心意，遵行神旨。  荣耀归于神！ 
450 BURIED WITH CHRIST AND RAISED WITH  HIM TOO
1 Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too; 
 What is there left for me to do? 
 Simply to cease from struggling and strife, 
 Simply to walk in newness of life. 
 Glory be to God! 
2 Risen with Christ, my glorious Head, 
 Holiness now the pathway I tread, 
 Beautiful thought, while walking therein: 
 He that is dead is freed from sin. 
 Glory be to God! 
3 Living with Christ, who dieth no more, 
 Following Christ, who goeth before; 
 I am from bondage utterly freed, 
 Reckoning self as dead indeed. 
 Glory be to God! 
4 Living for Christ, my members I yield, 
 Servants to God, for evermore sealed, 
 Not under law, I’m now under grace, 
 Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place. 
 Glory be to God! 
5 Growing in Christ; no more shall be named 
 Things of which now I’m truly ashamed, 
 Fruit unto holiness will I bear, 
 Life evermore, the end I shall share. 
 Glory be to God!
451 主你启示一个奥秘
1 主，你启示一个奥秘，  就是我同你死的理， 
 不用别法，不用别能，  我就看见完全得胜。 
2 你的十架就是我的， 
 其光照耀我生命里； 
 一信与你同钉那里， 
 世界失去它的能力。 
3 我既与你十架同钉， 
 胜过罪恶、自己、人情，  就怎能还追求地物？ 
 就怎能再盼望世福？ 
4 因此，我便到你那里，  与你同站十架死地， 
 你命、你权、全是我的，  因我与你合而为一。 
5 你既是来败坏仇敌 
 一切作为、权势、能力，  我自然可和你同胜， 
 天天经历你的大能。 
6 但是我主，我们只能 
 靠着你的十架得胜； 
 你走的路，我们当走，  直到与你见面时候。 
7 我今接受你的同钉， 
 求你所赐永远的灵， 
 使我更懂你死意义， 
 使我脱离罪、己、肉体。 
8 我愿得胜像你得胜！ 
 与你同王，同得权能！  背负十架，我们若肯，  这些荣耀必定有分！ 
451 LORD THOU HAST SHOWN THE MYSTERY
1 Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery, 
 How on the Cross I died with Thee; 
 I need no other pow’r or way 
 That I may triumph day by day. 
2 That cross of Thine is also mine, 
 Into my life its light doth shine; 
 When I believe I’m dead with Thee, 
 The world has lost its pow’r o’er me. 
3 Since I am crucified with Thee, 
 From sin and self I am set free; 
 How can I still enjoy the world 
 Or seek its vanities unfurled? 
4 I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee 
 Upon the cross of Calvary. 
 Thy life and power then are mine, 
 Since Thou and I in oneness twine. 
5 Since Thou didst come to slay the foe, 
 His work and power to overthrow, 
 I too can overcome in Thee 
 And prove Thy mighty pow’r in me. 
6 Yet, for the vict’ry we rely 
 Upon the death which Thou didst die; 
 We tread the path which Thou hast trod 
 Until we reach the goal in God. 
7 My death with Thee I now believe 
 And all its meaning would receive. 
 Thy death more deeply show to me, 
 That from my flesh I may be free. 
8 I long to win as Thou hast won, 
 To reign with Thee when Thou dost come. 
 If we the cross will gladly bear, 
 Then in Thy glory we will share.
452 罪律辖制的囚徒
1 罪律辖制的囚徒，
 今已完全释放！ 
 生命之灵的活律， 
 从里使你刚强。 
 依靠生命之圣灵， 
 祂就要来管理： 
 你魂对外的门户 
 你身上众肢体。 
2 你已与主同钉死， 
 在祂里已释放！ 
 从里到外，祂早已  毁坏罪的力量。 
 身体不再如无”律”，  可以任意而行； 
 昔无忌惮，今则有  “生命之律”执政。 
3 深深栽于主的死， 
 在祂里已得释！ 
 生命之气向你吹， 
 生命大能开释。 
 生命复苏的力量， 
 你灵里渐增强； 
 魂与身体受管治， 
 肢体不再抵抗。 
4 今与复活主联结， 
 在祂里面释放！ 
 藉争战祷告奏凯， 
 加略得胜同享。 
 因祂自由得释放， 
 胜过黑暗军旅； 
 祂的生命已胜过， 
 罪与死亡之律。 
452 MADE FREE MADE FREE O CAPTIVE
1 Made free! Made free! O captive! 
 Bound by the law of sin, 
 The law of life in Spirit 
 Will quicken you within. 
 And counting on the Spirit, 
 His life shall now control 
 The members of your body, 
 The portals of your soul. 
2 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 For crucified with Him, 
 From center to circumf’rence, 
 He breaks the power of sin. 
 No longer act in body 
 As if it had no “law”; 
 His “law of life” must govern 
 All that ran wild before. 
3 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 Deep planted in His death, 
 He liberates His life pow’r, 
 And breathes His Spirit’s breath. 
 Then waxing strong in spirit, 
 With force of quickening life; 
 The soul and body governed, 
 Its members cease from strife! 
4 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 Joined to the Risen One, 
 By conflict prayer you triumph, 
 And claim His victory won. 
 Freed with His glorious freedom, 
 Above the darkness rife; 
 For now the law of sin and death 
 Is conquered by His life.
453 真美丽真美丽
 1 真美丽，真美丽，

453 BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL
1 Experiencing the Lord
 Beautiful, beautiful, 
 Jesus is beautiful; 
 And Jesus makes beautiful things of my life.  Carefully touching me, 
 Causing my eyes to see; 
 Jesus makes beautiful things of my life.

454 我本瞎眼不能看见
1 我本瞎眼，不能看见  主的面貌所显恩典，  但今你的美丽脸面  向我射出灿烂光线。 
2 我本耳聋，不能听见  主口所出一切美言；  但今欢欣，因已听见  你的声音何其甘甜！ 
3 我本哑口，不能发表  主名所含恩典、荣耀；  但今已被圣火点着，  我唇将你赞美、称道。 
4 我本死沉，对你冷漠，  不肯前来得主丰富；  但今你已将我点活，  脱离罪的黑暗坟墓。 
5 主，你已使盲者复明，  聋者听见，哑者发言，  死者得活；看哪，我今  断开一切捆我锁炼！ 
454 LORD I WAS BLIND I COULD NOT SEE
1 Lord, I was blind; I could not see 
 In Thy marred visage any grace, 
 But now the beauty of Thy face 
 In radiant vision dawns on me. 
2 Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear 
 The thrilling music of Thy voice; 
 But now I hear Thee and rejoice, 
 And all Thine uttered words are dear! 
3 Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak 
 The grace and glory of Thy name; 
 But now, as touched with living flame, 
 My lips Thine eager praises wake. 
4 Lord, I was dead; I could not stir 
 My lifeless soul to come to Thee; 
 But now, since Thou hast quickened me, 
 I rise from sin’s dark sepulcher. 
5 For Thou hast made the blind to see, 
 The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, 
 The dead to live; and, lo, I break 
 The chains of my captivity.
455 以爱为旗在我以上 特.和.

和 以爱！以爱！ 
 以爱为旗在我以上；  祂带我进入祂的筵宴所，  祂以爱为旗在我以上。 
2 祂的果子何其甘甜，  祂的果子何其甘甜；  我在祂的筵宴所里饱尝，  哦，祂的果子何其甘甜。 
和 甘甜！甘甜！ 
 祂的果子何其甘甜；  我在祂的筵宴所里饱尝，  哦，祂的果子何其甘甜。

 His banner over me is love;

(C) Is love! Is love! 
 His banner over me is love; 
 He brought me into His banqueting house,  And His banner over me is love.

 His fruit is sweet unto my taste; 
 I’m feasting here in His banqueting house,  And His fruit is sweet unto my taste. 
(C) How sweet! How sweet! 
 His fruit is sweet unto my taste;

456 耶稣在我灵里
1 特.和.
经历主──在祂的宝贵里 
1 耶稣在我灵里， 
 无何比此更宝贵！ 
 祂除去我挂虑， 
 满有平安滋味。 
 祂绝不我弃， 
 虽我日久渐疲惫； 
 永远和我一起， 
 我乐藏身在祂的膀臂。 
和 我求祂名：”主耶稣，来帮助我的软弱。”   祂的生命，每日在我里面供应，  是何等稳妥！ 
2 耶稣在我灵里， 
 无何比此更宝贵！ 
 祂挽回我心意， 
 尝祂生命美味。 
 无一我所为 -  
 乃祂怜悯临到我； 
 神白白的恩惠， 
 使我过无穷喜乐生活。 
456 NOTHING’S QUITE SO PRECIOUS IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
1 Nothing’s quite so precious 
 As Jesus in my spirit. 
 He takes away the care 
 And fills me with His peace. 
 He never leaves me, 
 E’en as the days grow weary. 
 His presence goes with me. 
 My soul delights to hide in His arms. 
(C) I call His name, “Lord Jesus, Help me in my weakness.”  So faithfully each day in me 
 He proves His life is so sufficient. 
2 Nothing’s quite so precious 
 As Jesus in my spirit. 
 He tums my heart to Him, 
 To feast upon His life. 
 It’s nothing I do —  
 His mercy’s just upon me. 
 And God’s free gift of grace 
 Becomes an endless joy to me.
457 亲爱主宝贝主
1 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 我轻视我事物； 
 有谁像你如此美丽？  如此甘甜？如此柔细？  你是人中无比， 
 谁能与你相匹？ 
2 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 我听见你招呼； 
 你的声音入我心内，  我就脱离所有缠累，  骄傲都归虚无， 
 追求都变庸俗。 
3 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 我怎能再顽固？ 
 我将刚硬投你脚旁，  领首诗歌回家去唱，  欢喜作你奴仆， 
 欢喜向你屈服。 
4 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 我拣选你道路； 
 一面顺服，一面流泪，  但我不肯改变地位，  我要讨你喜悦， 
 羡慕爱的暴虐。 
5 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 自从你去天府， 
 我脸好像不能再笑，  我天好像不能再晓，  我只想你回来， 
 我只想你同在。 
6 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 让我向你倾诉， 
 你是我所朝夕思慕，  只有你能使我满足，  得你什么都有， 
 你外无所要求。 
7 亲爱主！宝贝主！ 
 我奉献我事物； 
 有谁像你如此美丽？  如此甘甜，如此柔细？  你是人中无比， 
 谁能与你相匹？ 
457 DEAR LORD JESUS PRECIOUS JESUS
1 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Thou hast won each love from me; 
 Who like Thee — so fair and comely? 
 Who like Thee — so sweet and lovely? 
 Matchless One, unrivaled beauty, 
 None can e’er compete with Thee! 
2 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Gladly will I hear Thy call; 
 Since Thy voice my heart hath entered, 
 I from all things could but sever; 
 Void are all my other seekings, 
 Every pride hath disappeared. 
3 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 How can I still stubborn be? 
 At Thy feet cast all my hard’nings, 
 And return with songs and singings; 
 ‘Tis my love to be Thy bondslave, 
 ‘Tis my joy to Thee obey. 
4 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Thy way only will I choose; 
 Though in tears while I’m obeying, 
 Yet I would not change my standing; 
 All I long for is Thy pleasure, 
 And the peace Thy love would bring. 
5 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 When Thy presence does depart, 
 Seems the dawn has lost its traces, 
 Hidden am my smiling faces; 
 All I yearn for is Thy coming 
 And Thy presence’ sweet embrace. 
6 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Can I tell it all to Thee? 
 Thou my love and satisfaction, 
 Thou my everlasting portion; 
 Thou art all that I desire, 
 Nothing else I would pursue. 
7 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 All I have I give to Thee; 
 Who like Thee — so fair and comely? 
 Who like Thee — so sweet and lovely? 
 Matchless One, unrivaled beauty, 
 None can e’er compete with Thee!
458 我心感觉天天被吸引更亲近耶稣
1 我心感觉天天被吸引，更亲近耶稣；  祂比黎明灿烂金色荣光更加耀目；  祂是我的幻想与美梦，我心所倾注；  祂是天天更加甘甜，今日远胜昨日。 
和 一半也难领略到，金色海岸那边；  昨日，今日，到永远，祂是天天更甘甜。 
2 当我遥见主，祂的荣光照进我眼目，  祂比百合花更鲜艳，比晨星更显著；  祂使我渴慕的心灵一再得着满足，  祂是天天更加甘甜，今日远胜昨日。 
3 我心虽有时沉重，祂慰藉使我心展；  当我黯然且神伤，祂怀来将我爱怜；  祂如此担我重负，我心怎不将祂恋？  祂是天天更加甘甜，今日远胜昨日。 
458 TO JESUS EV’RY DAY I FIND MY HEART IS  CLOSER DRAWN
14.14.14.14. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 To Jesus ev’ry day I find my heart is closer drawn;  He’s fairer than the glory of the gold and purple dawn;  He’s all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more;  Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before. 
(C) The half cannot be fancied this side the golden shore;  Oh, there He’ll be still sweeter than He ever was before. 
2 His glory broke upon me when I saw Him from afar;  He’s fairer than the lily, brighter than the morning star;  He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o’er and o’er,  Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before. 
3 My heart is sometimes heavy, but He comes with sweet relief;  He folds me to His bosom when I droop with blighting grief;  I love the Christ who all my burdens in His body bore;  Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
459 耶稣只要一想到你
1 耶稣，只要一想到你，  我心就满甘甜； 
 但这甘甜， 
 还远不及亲眼看见你面。 
2 无口能唱，无心能思，  也无记性能忆， 
 一种声音比你名字  更为甘甜、可喜。 
3 你是痛悔者的盼望，  温柔者的喜乐； 
 你对寻求者何善良，  跌倒者何仁德。 
4 但对寻得你者如何？  无口无笔能述； 
 耶稣的爱，其深、其阔，  惟被爱者略熟。 
5 耶稣！你是世人之光，  你是生命之源！ 
 远超一切我之所享、  一切我所能羡。 
6 你外我无别的源头  能解我心干渴； 
 无穷宝泉！活水涌流！  别流全都干涸。 
7 耶稣，你今是我喜乐，  将来是我赏赐； 
 你是我的荣耀、诗歌，  从今直到永世。 
459 JESUS THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEE
1 Jesus, the very thought of Thee 
 With sweetness fills my breast; 
 But sweeter far Thy face to see, 
 And in Thy presence rest. 
2 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, 
 Nor can the memory find 
 A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name, 
 O Savior of mankind! 
3 O Hope of every contrite heart,  
 O Joy of all the meek, 
 To those who fall, how kind Thou art! 
 How good to those who seek! 
4 But what to those who find? Ah, this 
 Nor tongue nor pen can show; 
 The love of Jesus, what it is 
 None but His loved ones know. 
5 O Jesus! light of all below! 
 Thou fount of life and fire! 
 Surpassing all the joys we know, 
 And all we can desire. 
6 No other source have we but Thee, 
 Soul-thirst to satisfy. 
 Exhaustless spring! the waters free! 
 All other streams are dry. 
7 Jesus, our only Joy be Thou, 
 As Thou our Prize wilt be; 
 Jesus, be Thou our Glory now, 
 And through eternity.
460 凉爽你像柔和微风
1 凉爽，你像柔和微风，  怎能将你吸够！
 芬芳胜过所有花丛，  如同没药在我怀中，  又像天上膏油！ 
 又像天上膏油！ 
2 滋润，你像清晨甘露，  怎能被你浸够！ 
 新鲜、清凉、消干、解枯、  滋我心情、润我深处；  愿你将我浸透。 
 愿你将我浸透。 
3 你是美丽中的至美，  怎能将你赏够！ 
 你的面容所发光辉，  使我更感你美可贵：  你是美中之首！ 
 你是美中之首！ 
4 你是救主、我主、我友，  怎能将你侍够！ 
 我真不愿随意自由，  甘心服事，殷勤不休，  直到一生尽头！ 
 直到一生尽头！ 
5 你名香甜远超众名，  怎能将你唱够！ 
 我心充满甜美感应，  深愿向你不住颂称！  喜乐涌自心头。 
6 你的自己可爱、饶优，  怎能将你说够！ 
 你心柔细，同情、俯就，  吸引我心向你倚投，  细语：”有你就够！”   细语：”有你就够！”  
460 I CANNOT BREATHE ENOUGH OF THEE
1 I cannot breathe enough of Thee, 
 O gentle breeze of love; 
 More fragrant than the myrtle tree 
 The Henna-flower is to me, 
 The Balm of Heaven above. 
 The Balm of Heaven above. 
 (英诗无第二节)  
3 I cannot gaze enough on Thee, 
 Thou Fairest of the Fair; 
 My heart is filled with ecstasy, 
 As in Thy face of radiancy 
 I see such beauty there. 
 I see such beauty there. 
4 I cannot yield enough to Thee, 
 My Savior, Master, Friend; 
 I do not wish to go out free, 
 But ever, always, willingly, 
 To serve Thee to the end. 
 To serve Thee to the end. 
5 I cannot sing enough of Thee, 
 The sweetest name on earth; 
 A note so full of melody 
 Comes from my heart so joyously, 
 And fills my soul with mirth. 
6 I cannot speak enough of Thee, 
 I have so much to tell; 
 Thy heart it beats so tenderly 
 As Thou dost draw me close to Thee, 
 And whisper, “All is well.” 
 And whisper, “All is well.”
461 耶稣我主你是属我
1 耶稣，我主！你是属我，  是父的爱所赐福分；  你的一切所是、所作，  今都已成我的永分。 
2 贫穷、软弱、可怜如我，  今竟能归荣耀给你；  我今已蒙宝血洗濯，  使我成为神的公义。 
3 你之所有成我永分，  我的泉源藏你里头；  因你我活，欢然承认：  我是无有，你是万有！ 
4 哦，我救主，教我靠近，  藏在你的受伤肋边，  时刻领受”恩上加恩”，  直至面见你的荣脸。 
461 JESUS MY SAVIOR THOU ART MINE
1 Jesus, my Savior! Thou art mine, 
 The Father’s gift of love divine; 
 All Thou hast done, and all Thou art, 
 Are now the portion of my heart. 
2 Poor, feeble, wretched, as I am, 
 I now can glory in Thy name; 
 Now cleansed in Thy most precious blood  And made the righteousness of God. 
3 All that Thou hast Thou hast for me, 
 All my fresh springs are hid in Thee; 
 In Thee I live; While I confess 
 I nothing am, yet all possess. 
4 O Savior, teach me to abide 
 Close sheltered at Thy wounded side, 
 Each hour receiving “grace on grace,” 
 Until I see Thee face to face.

 须让祂在里长大 -  
 阿们，主！阿们，主！阿们，主！

463 何等荣耀何等得胜
1 何等荣耀，何等得胜，  神自己来成为人！ 
 亲自穿上人的性情，  叫神计划得完成； 
 借着十架败坏魔鬼，  祂是人子已高升！ 
2 耶稣凭着人的美德，  将那诡诈者捕捉； 
 以人身分抵挡恶者，  所有试探全胜过！ 
 如今我在灵的里头，  拥有祂一切美德。 
3 祂的柔细为人生命，  乃是在耶稣灵里， 
 人性美德因祂能以  与神圣灵调为一。 
 如今这灵丰富无比，  足供全人类所需。 
4 何等奥秘，却是真实，  人子在我里面住！ 
 祂正扩展到我全人，  要从我里面活出。 
 阿利路亚，阿利路亚，  我要赞美永不止。 
5 何等奇妙，何等荣耀，  神今在肉身显现！ 
 我们乃是祂的肢体，  为将祂人性彰显。 
 我们现在凭祂而活，  让神居所早得建。 
463 WHAT A VICTORY WHAT A TRIUMPH
1 What a victory! What a triumph! 
 God Himself became a man, 
 Clothed Himself in human nature 
 To fulfill His mighty plan. 
 He through death destroyed the devil; 
 Risen now, the Son of Man! 
2 Jesus by His human virtues 
 Did the subtle one arrest; 
 He as man withstood the tempter, 
 Fully passed through every test. 
 Now in spirit I can take Him, 
 All His virtues to possess. 
3 In the Spirit of this Jesus 
 Is His human life so fine. 
 Human virtues have been added 
 To the Spirit all divine. 
 What abundance in this Spirit, 
 Rich supply for all mankind! 
4 How mysterious! Yet how real! 
 Such a man now lives in me. 
 Into all my heart He’s spreading —  
 He, my human life, to be. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
 I will praise unceasingly. 
5 Oh, what wonder! Oh, how glorious! 
 God in flesh is manifest. 
 We the members of His Body 
 His humanity express. 
 For the building of God’s dwelling 
 We His human life possess.

 祂是我们的模型。 
3 我们也需祂的复活， 
 作到我们全人里； 
 愿灵、魂、体，因这工作，  完全被带进神里。

 我们的灵已复活。 
 更藉享受祂话恩赐， 
 使魂也得以复活。 
6 我们心思、情感、意志，  每时刻需被拯救！

 直到全人变化尽致， 
 模成基督的形体。

 See, He left behind His grave-clothes; 
 In the new creation, He.

 That is where we want to be; 
 Living in the new creation 
 Now and for eternity. 
2 All His being e’en His body, 
 Now are in divinity. 
 He with God is fully mingled, 
 And our prototype is He! 
3 We too need His resurrection 
 In our being to be wrought 
 That our spirit, soul, and body 
 Into God be fully brought. 
4 Lord, we seek an extra portion 
 Of the resurrection life. 
 This our goal — out-resurrection 
 From the old creation rife. 
5 Resurrected was our spirit 
 When we into Thee believed. 
 Now our soul needs resurrection 
 By the Spirit’s word received. 
6 How our mind, will, and emotion 
 Need His rescue every hour! 
 Lord, uplift from our old being 
 All our inward parts with power. 
7 Then the God of resurrection 
 To our body will give life, 
 And we’ll live in resurrection, 
 Every part conformed to Christ.

 But Christ that lives in me, 
 Who from the law of sin 
 And death has made me free.

 不久将到。

 再无人如此慈祥， 
 如此善良。

 The Help of all Who find, 
 None other is so loving,

 主所命定生活的秘诀？  主在祂话中已答覆，  “基督是我们生命。”   敞开你心，投靠救主，  凭信让祂来居衷。 
2 基督，那受膏者掌权，  治理祂所救众人，  日复一日更多彰显  在人里外的大能。  你所不能成就之事，  让祂灵运行于你，  你魂便能将此证实：  “非我，乃主在我里。”

4 主，我单纯来安息于  你信实不变的话，  我信宝血将我清洗，  并基督是主为大。  愿我作你运河，不断  流出你生命与爱；  赢得那些坐在黑暗  中宝贵灵魂归来。

 Open now thy heart, and trust Him, 
 There to dwell, henceforth, by faith. 
2 Christ, the Lord’s Anointed, reigning 
 O’er the life He died to win, 
 Daily shall reveal more fully 
 His great power, without, within. 
 What thou never could’st accomplish 
 Shall His Spirit work through thee, 
 While thy soul this witness beareth, 
 ‘Tis not I, but Christ in me. 
3 In Him dwelleth all God’s fulness, 
 In Him thou art made complete; 
 Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright, 
 Kneeling at thy Father’s feet. 
 He will never disappoint thee, 
 Praise Him that the gift is thine; 
 Then go forth to live each moment 
 On sufficiency divine. 
4 Lord, I come, and simply resting 
 On Thy faithful, changeless word, 
 I believe the blood doth cleanse me, 
 And that Christ is crowned Lord. 
 Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow 
 Of Thy life and love through me; 
 Reaching those who sit in darkness, 
 Winning priceless souls to Thee.

 Christ in me, Christ in me,

 Seeking our hearts to gain.

 Jesus my heart’s dear King; 
 I who so often have grieved Him, 
 All to His feet would bring.

 Christ is my all in all?

 This my glad song shall be;

 And Christ abides in me.

5 祂保证救我们到底，  祂的生命在成全；  祂为我们，凡事亲理，  为使我们得完全。  我们生命只有失败，  但祂生命已经奏凯，  完全救恩已带来！

472 SING PRAISE TO CHRIST WHO LIVES IN  US
1 Sing praise to Christ Who lives in us, 
 The God of our salvation; 
 Who saves us by His life divine, 
 And not by regulation; 
 After we’ve worked - done all we can, 
 His life has power to change a man: 
 His life divine can change us. 
2 He saves us to the uttermost 
 By His life-giving power; 
 Transfusing Himself into us, 
 He saves us hour by hour. 
 He saved the lost by coming in, 
 He’s saving now from more than sin: 
 He’s saving us to glory! 
3 Our Lord was constituted priest 
 To be a real life-giver; 
 Life is the nature of this One 
 Who can from self deliver: 
 His life is indestructible, 
 By it He saves us to the full: 
 Praise God, He’s fully able! 
4 His life is fully qualified 
 To bring us through to glory; 
 Were it not for His tested life, 
 ‘Twould be another story: 
 His life was fully tried on earth, 
 To crucifixion from His birth: 
 He passed through death and Hades. 
5 He’s Pledged to save us to the full, 
 His life is operating; . 
 He’s doing everything for us 
 ‘Tis all for our perfecting; 
 Our life’s a failure at its best, 
 Only His life can stand the test: 
 His life brings full salvation! 
6 He’s living now to intercede, 
 Continuing forever; 
 He undertakes into the age, 
 His priesthood changes never; 
 He always lives to intercede, 
 Such a High Priest is what we need: 
 He’s higher than the heavens. 
7 Come forward now to God through Him, 
 Ne’er shrink back to destruction; 
 Come forward now to get.the life, 
 Which brings the proper function; 
 Come forward now the life to take; 
 By life His people us He’ll make, 
 And swallow death forever.

 How precious did that tree become 
 When I began to eat.

2 前常用手抓主，今主手牵我；  前常无所适从，今抛锚稳妥；  前是宝贵感觉，今凭主口说；  前是频频苦试，今完全信托。 
3 前是忙于打算，今则靠祈求；  前是悬切挂虑，今则主担忧；  前随我之所欲，今听主支配；  前不住的讨问，今不断赞美。 
4 前我欲利用主，今则主用我；  前是我的事业，今为主工作；  前欲得人称赞，今求主欢喜；  前不过半得救，今被救到底。 
5 前羡慕得着主，今知主属我；  前我灯将熄灭，今则光炳烁；  前所望的是死，今等候被提；  我所有的一切，都在主自己。 
475 ONCE IT WAS THE BLESSING NOW IT IS  THE LORD
6.5.6.5.D. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Once it was the blessing, Now it is the Lord; 
 Once it was the feeling, Now it is His Word; 
 Once His gift I wanted, Now, the Giver own; 
 Once I sought for healing, Now Himself alone. 
(C) All in all forever, Only Christ I’ll sing; 
 Everything is in Christ, And Christ is everything. 
2 Once ‘twas painful trying, Now ‘tis perfect trust;  Once a half salvation, Now the uttermost; 
 Once ‘twas ceaseless holding, Now He holds me fast;  Once ‘twas constant drifting, Now my anchor’s cast. 
3 Once ‘twas busy planning, Now ‘tis trustful prayer;  Once ‘twas anxious caring, Now He has the care;  Once ‘twas what I wanted, Now what Jesus says;  Once ‘twas constant asking, Now ‘tis ceaseless praise. 
4 Once it was my working, His it hence shall be; 
 Once I tried to use Him, Now He uses me; 
 Once the pow’r I wanted, Now the Mighty One; 
 Once for self I labored, Now for Him alone. 
5 Once I hoped in Jesus, Now I know He’s mine; 
 Once my lamps were dying, Now they brightly shine;  Once for death I waited, Now His coming hail; 
 And my hopes are anchored Safe within the veil.
476 我们看见基督是实际
1 我们看见基督是实际， 
 但是不能只看见而已， 
 祂在我们所有的经历， 
 必须是一切。 
 祷告之时，瞻仰祂荣面， 
 读经、聚会认识祂恩典， 
 但在日常生活的细节， 
 祂是否一切？ 
 阿利路亚！在光中看见， 
 主是何等真实又完全， 
 只要我们在每一时间， 
 在每一天，并在每一事件，  随处多方回到祂前 -  
 经历祂的实际须具体！ 
 不再笼统，摸不着边际！ 
 只要应用祂，就必经历祂乃是一切。 
2 我们一生充满了机会， 
 父所安排，为显祂智慧。 
 一切遭遇是最好最美， 
 使我得基督 -  
 祂是内容，祂也是实际， 
 我们将祂来照耀不已， 
 你我身上祂必须有路， 
 祂必须有路。 
 阿利路亚！我们的身体， 
 常带主的死，被置死地， 
 祂的生命得显明无比。 
 外面的人虽然渐渐毁坏， 
 里面的人却新起来 -  
 周围的人就都能看见， 
 宝贝实际在瓦器里面， 
 福音荣光全得着彰显 -  
 是借着我们。 
 不是道理也不是神学， 
 乃是实际内容毫不缺， 
 基督作了你我的一切。 
 祂乃是我一切！ 
476 WE HAVE SEEN CHRIST IS REALITY IRREGULAR METER
1 We have seen Christ is reality: 
 But it’s not sufficient just to see: 
 He in our experience must be 
 Everything to us. 
 We in prayer behold Him face to face, 
 In the Word and meetings know His grace;  But in daily life, in every place, 
 What is He to us? 
 Hallelujah! By His light we see 
 Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be 
 If we’ll only turn to Him at every time, 
 in every day, 
 Every thing, in every way and —  
 Be specific for reality! 
 And be done with generality! 
 If we’ll just apply Him, we will see He’s everything to us. 
2 Life is full of opportunities 
 Ordered by our Father’s hand: we see 
 Everything’s the best that it could be, 
 So let’s gain Christ! 
 Christ our content and reality 
 To shine out from us unceasingly: 
 He must have a way in you and me, 
 He must have a way. 
 Hallelujah! In the body we 
 Bear the death of Christ continually: 
 Thus His life comes forth for all to see as 
 The outer man is broken down, 
 The inner man is shining so that —  
 In these earthen vessels men can see 
 There’s the treasure of reality! 
 Thus the gospel’s glorious light will be 
 Shining out from us. 
 Not just doctrines and theology, 
 But the content of reality: 
 Christ as everything in you and me, 
 He’s everything to us!
477 我的旧人已经被废除 特.
1 我的旧人已经被废除，  在十架上已与主同死；  现在他再无任何用处，  对我他已死。
 我的新人在我灵里住，  在我里面如活井涌出，  以祂丰盛生命来满布  我的每一部。 
 基督在我灵里作了主，  我心天天向祂不别属，  让里面的人有家可住：  一个地方可作住处， 
 一个地方成为祂的 -   那里是我完全的实际，  将祂所是向我全开启，  丰丰富富居住我心里，  作我活的主。 
2 藉这位主成形在我里，  我成祂身上的一肢体，  所有行动都不再单独，  乃与众圣徒。 
 基督必须是我活的主，  我们天然个性须拆除，  天天拆毁直到全了结，  基督作一切！ 
 惟有基督是我活的主，  再无自己的愿望、爱慕，  直到教会是基督本身，  建造成为一个新人，  使神永远旨意得成 -   神人完完全全的调和，  得到一个合式的居所，  建立起祂国度的权柄，  在这地全境。 
 不是单单基督的自己，  还有教会同配合为一，  取用基督自己的丰盛，  成一个新人。 
477 MY OLD PERSON HAS BEEN NULLIFIED IRREGULAR METER
1 My old person has been nullified; 
 With my Lord upon the cross he died; 
 Now in nothing shall he be applied; 
 He’s dead to me. 
 My new Person in my spirit dwells; 
 Springing in me as a bubbling well; 
 Flowing out until each part He fills 
 With abundant life. 
 Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives; 
 And my heart to Him I’d daily give; 
 That my inner man could have a home 
 And a place to settle down, yes, 
 A place to call His own, and —  
 There be my complete reality, 
 There expressing all He is to me, 
 Living in my heart abundantly 
 As my Person real. 
2 By this Person being formed in me, 
 I’ll a member of His Body be, 
 No more acting individually, 
 But with the saints. 
 More and more our Person He must be; 
 That our natural personality 
 Be eliminated thoroughly 
 Till Christ is all. 
 Only Christ, our Person, must remain; 
 From our aims, our goals we must refrain, 
 Till the church be only Christ Himself 
 Built up as the one new man, 
 Thus fulfilling God’s great plan of —  
 Mingling fully with the human race 
 To obtain a proper dwelling place, 
 ‘Stablishing His kingdom’s rule and grace; 
 Over all the earth. 
 Not Himself just individually, 
 But the church together corporately, 
 Taking Christ as all in all, to be 
 The full-grown, perfect man.
478 主我们切求能认识
1 主，我们切求能认识  你是我们的主人；
 并在里面不断经历  你的丰满与福分。 
 不再仅是外面知识，  或只是心思着迷， 
 而藉最真实的接触，  使全人都能归你。 
和 主是我们主人， 
 住在我们心里， 
 愿我们都能不断经历  这个实际。 
2 全世界都在黑暗中，  被堕落之魂驾驭， 
 仇敌的计谋乃是要  将魂的生命管理。 
 直到神的怜悯促使  祂儿子住在人里， 
 今我们完全认识祂  在教会中的奥秘。 
3 我们前在旷野流荡，  生活行事全属魂， 
 从不知道我们的灵  渴望彰显神丰盛； 
 就当耶稣进来之际，  立刻使情况改变。 
 我们今以灵为中心，  阿利路亚！新改变！ 
4 何等荣耀的事实！
 基督自己在我们里，  彰显神性和神旨； 
 不是魂生命的幻想，  乃是灵刚强、壮大；  基督自己今作主人，  祂是属我、我属祂。 
478 LORD TO KNOW THEE AS OUR PERSON
1 Lord, to know Thee as our Person, 
 Earnestly we seek and pray; 
 To experience Thy fulness 
 In a constant inner way. 
 Never longer only outward 
 Or with soulish thoughts obsessed, 
 But, O Lord, in realest contact 
 We by Thee would be possessed. 
(C) Lord, Thou art our Person, 
 In our inmost being, 
 May we constantly experience 
 This reality. 
2 All the world is under darkness, 
 Driven by the fallen soul, 
 And the enemy designing 
 Does the soulish life control. 
 Such we were till God, through mercy, 
 Caused His Son to dwell in us; 
 Now we fully come to know Him 
 In His church so glorious. 
3 Once we walked a soulish person, 
 Wandering in the wilderness, 
 Never knowing that our spirit 
 Craved God’s fullness to express; 
 At the moment Jesus entered 
 Instantly the whole was changed. 
 Now we’re people spirit-centered! 
 Hallelujah! Rearranged! 
4 Now our spirit is our person —  
 What a glorious fact is this! 
 Christ Himself in us expressing 
 God’s intent and holiness. 
 Not the soul-life’s vain delusion, 
 But the spirit strengthened is; 
 Christ Himself is now our Person —  
 He is ours and we are His.
479 我的旧人已经与主同钉
1 我的旧人已经与主同钉，  它深处一切的污秽、恶性，  连古蛇性情也一同埋葬，  这个事实发生在我身上，  我要持守。 
2 今在我灵里另有一主人，  如新生婴儿，微小且幼嫩，  靠着神话纯净灵奶喂养，  好让”里面的人”长大、刚强，  赢得我心。 
3 主是我主人，须得着我心，  并在每一部分有如君临。  旧主人虽已死，但仍作祟。  哦主，愿我思、情、意都让给  你来作主。 
4 主，在灵里与我调和为一，  神性与人性都和谐如一；  但你仍需有一正常器皿，  好让你的荣耀性情显明  在我身上。 
5 主，因此我今将心献给你，  从此如同在你自己家里，  有一地方供你进来安息，  让你工作成就在新人里，  我恢复。 
479 MY OLD MAN HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH  HIM
1 My old man has been crucified with Him, 
 With all its foul corruption deep within; 
 And buried too its nature serpentine, 
 Completely finished — this great fact is mine, 
 I hold it fast. 
2 But there’s a Person in my spirit now, 
 Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low; 
 Who by the Word’s pure milk will grow to be 
 The overcoming inner man in me 
 To gain my heart. 
3 Christ as my Person must possess my heart 
 And be preeminent in every part. 
 The former owner died but haunts it still. 
 O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will 
 Now welcome Thee. 
4 In spirit mingled, we are one, 
 O Lord, The human and divine in one accord; 
 Yet Thou must have a proper faculty 
 That all Thy glorious personality 
 May be expressed. 
5 So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today, 
 That it may be Thy home in every way, 
 A place for Thee to come and settle down, 
 And all Thy grand recovery work to crown 
 In one new man.
480 哦基督在祂荣耀里穿上了人性
1 哦，基督在祂荣耀里穿上了人性，  藉此祂作我主人，并且内住于我；  祂的生命与所是，对我祂全适应，  故祂这荣耀主人，取代了我。 
和 哦主，哦主，你是那人为我！  我接受你作我主人， 
 作我的完全真体； 
 哦主，哦主，征服我每一部，  每一时刻，每一处所，安家在我心里。 
2 哦，基督成了那灵，在我里面说话，  作为那说话的灵，祂不停地说话。  祂的说话如水在里面将我冲刷，  清除我所有老旧，并分赐祂。 
和 哦主，哦主，尽量向我说话，  你说话是你的同在，我必接受不息；  哦主，哦主，说、洗我的各部，  藉新陈代谢的变化，安家在我心里。 
3 新郎基督就要来娶祂荣耀新妇，  藉从我们里面将教会荣耀发表；  祂这主人是荣耀在我里面展布，  这是我们的主人，何其荣耀！ 
和 哦主，哦主，借着你的经营，  将你荣耀彻底满溢、浸透我们全人；  来罢，来罢，在荣耀里显现，  哦，那尊荣者藉教会，在荣耀里显身。 
480 OH CHRIST IN ALL HIS GLORY PUT ON  HUMANITY
13.13.13.11. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Oh, Christ in all His glory put on humanity 
 So He could be my Person, and live inside of me.  A man in life and being, He fully fits my case, 
 So all His glorious Person can me replace. 
(C) O Lord, O Lord, You are the man for me! 
 I take You as my Person, as my full identity. 
 O Lord, O Lord, subdue my every part, 
 And every moment, every place, 
 Make home in all my heart. 
2 Oh, Christ became the Spirit to speak inside of me,  And as the speaking Spirit He speaks unceasingly.  His speaking is the water that washes me within,  Discharging all my oldness, impaiting Him. 
(C) O Lord, O Lord, speak all You want to me. 
 Your speaking is Your presence — I must have it constantly.  O Lord, O Lord, speak-wash my every part 
 And by this metabolic change, make home in all my heart. 
3 Oh, Christ will come, the Bridegroom, for us, His glorious Bride,  By coming from within us the church is glorified.  His Person is the glory expanding now in us; 
 This glory is our Person — how glorious! 
(C) O Lord, O Lord, by Your economy 
 So flood us with Your glory, saturate us thoroughly.  Come out, come out, break forth in glory here, 
 And from the church, O glorious One, in glory soon appear.
481 永远之神我心已定
1 永远之神，我心已定，  定于你，定于你； 
 我的拣选，一定永定，  主为我，主为我。  是我先知、祭司、君王，  带来救恩，免我死亡，  一息尚存，我仍要唱，  主为我，主为我。 
2 在主里我见神荣光，  主为我，主为我； 
 祂是神圣尊严君王，  主为我，主为我； 
 祂是父神喜悦爱子，  在宝座上与神同治，  独担人罪，并不推辞，  主为我，主为我。 
3 让人夸耀金银财富，  主为我，主为我； 
 祂的丰富无法尽述，  主为我，主为我； 
 你的财宝必将锈坏，  你的尊荣转瞬不再，  但我福分永存不衰，  主为我，主为我。 
4 无论健康，或是病苦，  主为我，主为我； 
 或处贫穷，或处丰富，  主为我，主为我； 
 当祂召我见祂之日，  我须应召不得延迟，  离开这个黑暗罪世，  主为我，主为我。 
481 MY HEART IS FIXED ETERNAL GOD
1 My heart is fixed, eternal God, 
 Fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee; 
 And my immortal choice is made, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 He is my prophet, priest, and king, 
 Who did for me salvation bring, 
 And while I’ve breath I’mean to sing, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me. 
2 In Him I see the Godhead shine, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 He is the majesty divine, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 The Father’s well-beloved Son, 
 Co-partner of His royal throne, 
 Who bore the guilt of man alone, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me. 
3 Let others boast of heaps of gold, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 His riches never can be told, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 Your gold will waste and wear away, 
 Your honors perish in a day; 
 My portion never can decay, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me. 
4 In pining sickness, or in health, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 In deepest poverty or wealth, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me; 
 And in that all-important day, 
 When I the summons must obey, 
 And pass from this dark world away, 
 Christ for me, Christ for me.
482 今世福乐没灭
1 今世福乐没灭，  基督属我！ 
 地上爱情断绝，  基督属我！ 
 在这幽暗野地，  无处可以安息，  惟有基督可倚，  基督属我！ 
2 莫诱我心离开，  基督属我！ 
 我愿与主同在，  基督属我！ 
 你这今世欢娱，  一时骗人之局，  从我心中离去，  基督属我！ 
3 去罢，今世幻梦，  基督属我！ 
 我今已经清醒，  基督属我！ 
 凡我从前所慕，  不过使我痛苦；  惟主使我满足，  基督属我！ 
4 去罢，短暂今时，  基督属我！ 
 来罢，长久永世，  基督属我！ 
 来罢，可爱福气！  来罢，甜美安息！  来罢，恩主自己！  基督属我！ 
482 FADE FADE EACH EARTHLY JOY
1 Fade, fade each earthly joy; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Break every tender tie; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Dark is the wilderness, 
 Earth has no resting place, 
 Jesus alone can bless; 
 Jesus is mine. 
2 Tempt not my soul away; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Here would I ever stay; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Perishing things of clay, 
 Born but for one brief day, 
 Pass from my heart away; 
 Jesus is mine. 
3 Farewell, ye dreams of night; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Lost in this dawning bright; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 All that my soul has tried 
 Left but a dismal void; 
 Jesus has satisfied; 
 Jesus is mine. 
4 Farewell, mortality; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Welcome, eternity; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Welcome, O Loved and Blest, 
 Wecome, sweet scenes of rest, 
 Welcome, my Savior’s breast; 
 Jesus is mine.

483 耶稣我救主祂是我一切
1 耶稣为我。
和 耶稣为我！耶稣为我！  每时候，每处所，耶稣为我！

483 JESUS MY SAVIOR IS ALL THINGS TO ME
1 Jesus, my Savior, is all things to me; 
 Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He, 
 Guiding, protecting, o’er life’s rolling sea, 
 Mighty Deliv’rer — Jesus for me. 
(C) Jesus for me, Jesus for me, 
 All the time everywhere, Jesus for me. 
2 Jesus in sickness, and Jesus in health, 
 Jesus in poverty, comfort or wealth; 
 Sunshine or tempest, whatever it be, 
 He is my safety — Jesus for me. 
3 He is my Refuge, my Rock, and my Tower, 
 He is my Fortress, my Strength and my Pow’r; 
 Life everlasting, my Daysman is He, 
 Blessed Redeemer — Jesus for me. 
4 He is my Prophet, my Priest and my King, 
 He is my Bread of Life, Fountain and Spring; 
 Bright Sun of Righteousness, Daystar is He, 
 Horn of Salvation — Jesus for me. 
5 Jesus in sorrow, in joy, or in pain, 
 Jesus my Treasure in loss or in gain; 
 Constant Companion where’er I may be, 
 Living or dying — Jesus for me.
484 主我还有谁在天上
1 主，我还有谁在天上？  惟有你！惟有你！  我的一生只此可唱：  主为我！主为我！  祂已为我流血辛劳，  祂作我的赎罪羊羔，  使我这人与神和好，  主为我！主为我！ 
2 我不追求自私福气，  我要主！我要主！  我不羡慕镀金玩意，  我要主！我要主！  自私福气不能长久，  性质定规瞬息甘休，  我的喜乐永远存留，  我要主！我要主！ 
3 我今弃绝为富思想，  主为我！主为我！  我不盼望自己安享，  主为我！主为我！  无花果树虽不发旺，  葡萄、橄榄无一可享，  棚内无牛、圈中无羊，  主为我！主为我！ 
4 我心现今完全安息，  主为我！主为我！  不怕试探常来攻击，  主为我！主为我！  任凭引诱力量汹涌，  我们靠主能够强勇，  能够冷笑它们无用，  主为我！主为我！ 
5 当我人生路程将毕，  我要主！我要主！  安全倚靠祂的手臂，  我要主！我要主！  我的躯壳虽有痛苦，  所有自然力量都无，  我仍高声歌唱欢呼，  我要主！我要主！ 
484 WHOM HAVE I LORD IN HEAV’N BUT THEE
1 Whom have I, Lord, in heav’n but Thee? 
 None but Thee! None but Thee! 
 And this my song through life shall be: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 He hath for me the serpent trod, 
 He hath redeemed me “by His blood,” 
 And reconciled my soul to God: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
2 I envy not the rich their joys: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 I covet not earth’s glitt’ring toys: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 Earth can no lasting bliss bestow, 
 “Fading” is stamped on all below; 
 Mine is a joy no end can know: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
3 Though with the poor be cast my lot: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 “He knoweth best,” I murmur not: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 Though “vine” and “fig-tree” blight assail, 
 The “labor of the olive fail,” 
 And death o’er flock and herd prevail, 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
4 Though I am now on hostile ground, 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 And sin beset me all around, 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 Let earth her fiercest battles wage, 
 And foes against my soul engage, 
 Strong in His strength I scorn their rage: 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
5 And when my life draws to its close, 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 Safe in His arms I shall repose, 
 Christ for me! Christ for me! 
 When sharpest pains my frame pervade, 
 And all the powers of nature fade, 
 Still will I sing through death’s cold shade; 
 Christ for me! Christ for me!
485 我已寻到宇宙至宝
1 我已寻到宇宙至宝，  我心因此欢呼； 
 欢呼基督给我得到，  何等一位基督！ 
2 我这基督是我先知，  满有启示、亮光， 
 也是祭司，神前尽职，  且是大能君王。 
3 我这基督是王中王，  祂是万主之主； 
 又是神的公义太阳，  医治所有病苦。 
4 基督是我食粮、活水，  我的医药、健康； 
 平安、力量、喜乐、安慰，  荣耀、冠冕、奖赏。 
5 基督乃是我父、我友，  我兄并我心爱； 
 中保、策士、盼望、元首，  在天为我担代。 
6 我这基督充满万有，  怎能述尽说竭？ 
 祂是首先、祂是末后，  祂是一切一切！ 
485 I’VE FOUND THE ONE OF PEERLESS  WORTH
1 I’ve found the One of peerless worth, 
 My heart doth sing for joy; 
 And sing I must, for Christ I have: 
 Oh, what a Christ have I! 
2 Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King; 
 My Prophet full of light; 
 My Priest that stands ‘twixt me and God, 
 My King that rules with might. 
3 My Christ, He is the Lord of lords, 
 He is the King of kings; 
 He is the Sun of Righteousness, 
 With healing in His wings. 
4 Christ is my meat, Christ is my drink, 
 My medicine and my health; 
 My peace, my strength, my joy, my crown,  My glory and my wealth. 
5 Christ is my Father, and my Friend, 
 My Brother, and my Love; 
 My Head, my Hope, my Counsellor, 
 My Advocate above. 
6 My Christ, He is the Heaven of heavens; 
 My Christ what shall I call? 
 My Christ is First, my Christ is Last, 
 My Christ is All in all.
486 主我感谢你已指示
1 主，我感谢你已指示，  我也开始认识 -  
 你对属你者将如何，  他们对你如何； 
 只要他们向你降服，  信而顺从你的召呼。 
2 何等奇妙，从未知晓  我能如此信靠； 
 在我一切所行路途，  对我你何丰足， 
 供应我的一切需要，  满足我心所慕、所祷。 
3 我接受你作我保守，  今将我交你手， 
 我魂、道路、事工、问题，  全部交你管理； 
 我知我所信托一切，  你必保守完整无缺。 
4 主，我接受你作平安，  保守我的心坎， 
 风暴之中有你平安，  使我不致慌乱； 
 正如你的国度扩展，  你的平安也在加深。 
5 我接受你作我智慧，  你是智慧总归； 
 拣选世上愚拙之人，  将我分别为圣， 
 叫我为你说话、工作，  如同你在我里所作。 
6 主，接受你作一切，  因你是我基业； 
 我无是处，一无所有，  但仍归你所有。 
 你就成为我的一切，  有你，我就凡事无缺。 
486 I THANK THEE LORD THAT THOU HAST  SHOWN
1 I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown, 
 And I begin to see, 
 What Thou canst be to all Thine own, 
 What they may be to Thee; 
 If only they will yield Thee all, 
 And trustingly obey Thy call. 
2 How wonderful! I never knew 
 That I might trust Thee so; 
 That Thou wouldst be so much to me, 
 In all the way I go, 
 That every need Thou wouldst supply. 
 And all my longings satisfy. 
3 I take Thee as my keeper now, 
 And I commit to Thee 
 My soul, my way, my works, my cause, 
 In Thy sole charge to be; 
 And my deposit, Thou, I know 
 Wilt guard secure from every foe. 
4 I take Thee for my peace, O Lord. 
 My heart to keep and fill. 
 Thine own great calm, amid earth’s storms 
 Shall keep me always still; 
 And as Thy kingdom doth increase, 
 So shall Thine ever-deep’ning peace. 
5 I take Thee as my wisdom too. 
 For wisdom’s sum Thou art: 
 Thou, who dost choose the foolish things. 
 Set me henceforth apart, 
 That I may speak and work for Thee 
 As Thou shalt work and speak in me. 
6 I take Thee, Lord, to be my all. 
 Since all Thou art is mine; 
 I nothing have, and nothing am; 
 That nothing, Lord, is Thine. 
 Thou shalt be everything to me, 
 In all things my sufficiency.
487 以前我心苦楚悲伤
1 以前我心苦楚悲伤，  永生之福无望； 
 惟有基督今为我王，  我心充满欢畅。 
和 今主耶稣满足我心，  并无别人如祂； 
 历久爱情、生命、欢欣，  都由耶稣赐下。 
2 以前我心思慕祝福，  并不来寻基督； 
 我虽忽略我的救主，  祂爱却来寻吾。 
3 我曾试过破裂水池，  希望痛快而喝； 
 哎哟，水却完全漏失，  讥讽我的干渴。 
4 祝福丧失，我心悲哀，  仍未想到祂来； 
 蒙昧心目，祂为我开，  始知祂是可爱。 
487 O CHRIST IN THEE MY SOUL HATH FOUND
1 O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found, 
 And found in Thee alone, 
 The peace, the joy I sought so long, 
 The bliss till now unknown. 
(C) Now none but Christ can satisfy, 
 None other name for me; 
 There’s love and life and lasting joy, 
 Lord Jesus, found in Thee. 
2 I sighed for rest and happiness, 
 I yearned for them, not Thee; 
 But, while I passed my Savior by, 
 His love laid hold on me. 
3 I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, 
 But, ah, the waters failed! 
 E’en as ! stooped to drink they fled, 
 And mocked me as I wailed. 
4 The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, 
 But never wept for Thee, 
 Till grace the sightless eyes received, 
 Thy loveliness to see.

488 基督就是我的世界 特.
1 基督就是我的世界：  生命、喜乐、一切！  是我能力，时时提挈，  离祂我就仆跌。 
 当我愁苦我来就祂，  无人如此安抚接纳；  使我心乐，解我心忧，  祂是我友！ 
2 基督就是我的世界：  百般试炼之助， 
 处处照护，事事体贴，  一再向我赐福。 
 祂赐日光，又赐甘霖，  祂赐收获，金榖丰稔；  日光甘霖，金榖丰收，  祂是我友！ 
3 基督就是我的世界，  对祂我必效忠！ 
 我怎能够将祂弃绝，  当祂施恩重重？ 
 随祂行走，必不会错，  有祂引领，昼夜无辍；  随祂行走，夜以继昼，  祂是我友！ 
4 基督就是我的世界，  更好朋友无需； 
 我愿与祂完全联结，  直到永世不渝。 
 美丽生命，配此良友，  美丽生命，直到永久；  永久生命，永久逍游，  祂是我友！ 
488 JESUS IS ALL THE WORLD TO ME IRREGULAR METER
1 Jesus is all the world to me: 
 My life, my joy, my all. 
 He is my strength from day to day; 
 Without Him I would fall.

 When I am sad, He makes me glad; 
 He’s my Friend. 
2 Jesus is all the world to me, 
 My Friend in trials sore. 
 I go to Him for blessings, and 
 He gives them o’er and o’er.

 He sends the harvest’s golden grain: 
 Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain —  
 He’s my Friend. 
3 Jesus is all the world to me, 
 And true to Him I’ll be. 
 Oh, how could I this Friend deny 
 When He’s so true to me? 
 Following Him I know I’m right; 
 He watches o’er me day and night. 
 Following Him by day and night,  
 He’s my Friend. 
4 Jesus is all the world to me, 
 I want no better friend. 
 I trust Him now; I’ll trust Him when 
 Life’s fleeting days shall end. 
 Beautiful life with such a Friend: 
 Beautiful life that has no end! 
 Eternal life, eternal joy, 
 He’s my Friend.

1 Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me 
 A living, bright reality, 
 More present to faith’s vision keen 
 Than any earthly object seen; 
 More dear, more intimately nigh 
 Than e’en the closest earthly tie. 
2 And Thou, blest vision of my soul, 
 Hast made my broken nature whole; 
 Hast purified my base desires, 
 And kindled passion’s holiest fires; 
 My nature Thou hast lifted up, 
 And filled me with a glorious hope. 
3 Nearer and dearer still to me, 
 Thou living, loving Savior be; 
 Brighter the vision of Thy face, 
 More charming still Thy words of grace; 
 So, life shall be transformed to love, 
 Thy grace and mercy more to prove.

 我要住在神的家中，  直到永世无终。 
490 THE LORD’S MY SHEPHERD I’LL NOT  WANT
1 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want; 
 He makes me down to lie 
 In pastures green; He leadeth me 
 The quiet waters by. 
2 My soul He doth restore again, 
 And me to walk doth make 
 Within the paths of righteousness, 
 E’en for His own name’s sake. 
3 Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale, 
 Yet will I fear no ill; 
 For Thou art with me, and Thy rod 
 And staff me comfort still. 
4 My table Thou hast furnished 
 In presence of my foes; 
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint, 
 And my cup overflows. 
5 Goodness and mercy all my life 
 Shall surely follow me, 
 And in God’s house forevermore 
 My dwelling-place shall be.

 All the sheep of His pastures fare so wondrously fine,  His sheep am I .

1 是爱的神作我牧人，  祂常喂养并施恩； 
 祂是属我，我是属祂，  我必不至于缺乏。 
2 祂带我到活水溪边，  享受滋润和甘甜； 
 又带我到嫩草地场，  饱尝属天的食粮。

 将我轻放在祂肩上，  带我回家乐洋洋。

 你仗、你竿都安慰我，  十架在前引导我。

493 THE KING OF LOVE MY SHEPHERD IS
1 The King of love my Shepherd is, 
 Whose goodness faileth never; 
 I nothing lack if I am His, 
 And He is mine forever. 
2 Where streams of living water flow 
 My ransomed soul He leadeth, 
 And, where the verdant pastures grow, 
 With food celestial feedeth. 
3 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, 
 But yet in love He sought me, 
 And on His shoulder gently laid, 
 And home rejoicing brought me. 
4 In death’s dark vale I fear no ill 
 With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; 
 Thy rod and staff my comfort still, 
 Thy Cross before to guide me. 
5 Thou spread’st a table in my sight; 
 Thy unction grace bestoweth; 
 And oh, what transport of delight 
 From Thy pure chalice floweth! 
6 And so through all the length of days 
 Thy goodness faileth never; 
 Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise 
 Within Thy house forever.

494 LABORING ON JESUS THE GOOD LAND SO  REAL
10.10.10.10. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Laboring on Jesus, the good land so real, 
 Plowing and planting and watering the field. 
 He yields the produce of reality, 
 God reaps a harvest of Jesus in me. 
(C) O Jesus! You’re God’s good land 
 For me to labor on! 
 I’ll bit by bit possess You 
 Until the whole is won! 
 With Canaan is God’s purpose, 
 The labor He will bless; 
 Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself, 
 Your Person to possess. 
2 Laboring on Jesus! My heart has been set, 
 Labor’s begun, and I have no regret, 
 For with my labor God’s sending the rain, 
 And all my labor on Christ yields much gain. 
3 Laboring on Jesus this practical way —  
 Praying His Word in the spirit each day, 
 Foll’wing His living anointing within, 
 Built up with others, the church life to win. 
4 Laboring on Jesus yields reality, 
 Meetings of fullness for all men to see; 
 There God and man are indeed satisfied, 
 And there God’s presence cannot be denied. 
5 Labor on Jesus to have Him increased! 
 Then seek God’s dwelling and come to the feast! 
 There bring and offer your surplus to God, 
 There eat the riches, rejoice in the Lord!

495 主是包罗万有的地
1 主是包罗万有的地，  祂对我是一切； 
 祂是泉源、大川、小溪，  活水涌流不歇。 
 不断涌自高岗、低谷，  直到活水充满各处；  用祂生命浇灌圣徒，  何丰富！ 
2 道成肉身、受钉；
 长出大麦，给人看见：  祂是复活生命。 
 祂又是我们葡萄园 -   葡萄成酒，使人畅欢；  如此供应，满人心愿，  何甘甜！ 
3 哦，何等丰富的基督，  祂是那真石榴， 
 祂又是我们橄榄树，  油润人心、解忧。 
 祂这地又流奶与蜜，  甘甜、舒畅、滋养、加力；  如此基督，丰富无比，  何希奇！ 
4 我们在这美地饮食，  并无缺乏、不足； 
 在祂里面不缺一物，  祂是何等富足。 
 祂这美地广阔无限，  祂各方面都是完全；  地中之地，在人心坎  里扩展！ 
5 基督美地有铜铁矿，  出自祂的王权； 
 我们运用基督坚刚，  捆绑仇敌凶焰。 
 我们也经火炼之山，  如同精铜经火锻炼，  坚刚如铁，光明如铜，  是我愿！ 
6 主，为这地我们感赞  包罗万有基督！ 
 我们吃祂，被祂充满，  祂是何等充足！ 
 求教我们不断劳力，  在祂这广阔的美地； 是我喜乐，我所作息 
 的美地！ 
495 JESUS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE LAND
1 Jesus, the all-inclusive land, 
 Is everything to me: 
 A Christ of brooks, of depths and streams,  And fountains bubbling free. 
 Springing from valleys and from hills, 
 Flowing till every part He fills, 
 He waters us — how glorious —  
 By His life! 
2 Jesus is now the land of wheat —  
 Incarnate, crucified. 
 But resurrection life is He 
 By barley signified. 
 He is a land of figs and vines —  
 Blood of the grape, the cheering wine. 
 With such supplies He satisfies —  
 Christ our land! 
3 O what a rich, abundant Christ: 
 Our pomegranate true, 
 The olive tree whose oil is now 
 Anointing us anew. 
 Rich milk and honey He doth bring, 
 Sweet, satisfying, nourishing. 
 Our Christ is such; He is so much! 
 What a Christ ! 
4 In our good land we eat the bread —  
 There is no scarcity. 
 We never lack one thing in Him, 
 So rich, so full is He. 
 He is a land so vast, immense; 
 He is complete in every sense. 
 How He expands — land of all lands —   In our heart! 
5 Christ is a land of iron stones, 
 Whence comes authority. 
 We must dig out this solid Christ 
 To bind His enemy. 
 Then we must through the sufferings pass  To be refined as burnished brass. 
 With iron bind, as brass refined, 
 Is our need. 
6 Lord, how we bless Thee for this land, 
 The all-inclusive Christ ! 
 We’ve eaten Him, we’re filled with Him,  O how He has sufficed! 
 Teach us to labor constantly 
 Upon this vast reality; 
 This is our joy, this our employ —  
 Christ our land!
496 当我不见基督容华
1 当我不见基督容华， 
 时间何等无味、可厌！ 
 活泼的鸟、美丽的花， 
 对我就不再是甘甜； 
 可爱太阳如失光线， 
 田野枉欲表现欢喜； 
 当我快乐在祂里面， 
 阴霾也如晴空美丽。 
2 祂名发出最美香味， 
 祂声成为最甜音乐， 
 祂的同在展我愁眉， 
 使我里面尽都欢悦； 
 祂若如此不断亲密， 
 我就无何可怕、可求， 
 无人快乐与我可比， 
 我的春日常年长有。 
3 看见祂面我就甘甜， 
 我就只求祂的欢喜， 
 不论时地有何改变， 
 不能改变我的心意； 
 只要感觉祂的爱恋， 
 宫殿也成可笑玩具， 
 监狱可成荣耀宫殿， 
 如果基督和我同居。 
4 我主，若我真是属你， 
 你若是我诗歌、太阳， 
 请问为何我仍忧悒？ 
 为何严冬这样久长？ 
 或将黑云赶离我天， 
 恢复你的欢乐同在； 
 或接我到你的面前， 
 无冬昏昧，无云叆叇。  
(第四节“叆叇”意思是云层笼罩的样子)  
496 HOW TEDIOUS AND TASTELESS THE  HOURS
1 How tedious and tasteless the hours 
 When Jesus no longer I see! 
 Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow’rs,  Have all lost their sweetness to me. 
 The midsummer sun shines but dim, 
 The fields strive in vain to look gay; 
 But when I am happy in Him 
 December’s as pleasant as May. 
2 His name yields the richest perfume, 
 And sweeter than music His voice; 
 His presence disperses my gloom, 
 And makes all within me rejoice. 
 I should, were He always thus nigh, 
 Have nothing to wish or to fear; 
 No mortal so happy as I; 
 My summer would last all the year. 
3 Content with beholding His face, 
 My all to His pleasure resigned; 
 No changes of season or place, 
 Would make any change in my mind. 
 While blessed with a sense of His love, 
 A palace a toy would appear; 
 And prisons would palaces prove, 
 If Jesus would dwell with me there. 
4 My Lord, if indeed I am Thine, 
 If Thou art my sun and my song, 
 Say, why do I languish and pine? 
 And why are my winters so long? 
 Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky, 
 Thy soul-cheering presence restore; 
 Or take me to Thee up on high, 
 Where winter and clouds are no more.
497 进入幔内愿这福气你有分
1 “进入幔内！”愿这福气你有分，  到主隐密处，在祂荫下住；  瞻祂直至你脸、你生命、你唇，  流露祂荣耀、祂爱、祂称祝。 
2 “进入幔内，”惟在此至圣之殿，  方能注视祂无比的荣美；  你才可能成为祂活的彰显  祂爱的泱漭，祂恩的广沛。 
3 “进入幔内，”让主馨香将你熏，  出到幔外去，发出祂香味；  “进入幔内，”让祂手调整音韵，  使你欢奏出，爱祂的赞美。 
4 “进入幔内，”在主里将锚抛定，  使你能胜过，世俗的翻腾；  “进入幔内，”与主联合成一灵，  使你今在地，活复活生命。 
497 WITHIN THE VEIL BE THIS BELOV’D THY  PORTION
1 “Within the Veil”: be this, belov’d, thy portion, 
 Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell; 
 Beholding Him, until thy face His glory, 
 Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell. 
2 “Within the Veil,” for only as thou gazest 
 Upon the matchless beauty of His face, 
 Canst thou become a living revelation 
 Of His great heart of love, His untold grace. 
3 “Within the Veil,” His fragrance poured upon thee,  Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad; 
 “Within the Veil,” His hand shall tune the music 
 Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord. 
4 “Within the Veil,” thy spirit deeply anchored, 
 Thou walkest calm above a world of strife; 
 “Within the Veil,” thy soul with Him united, 
 Shall live on earth His resurrection life.
498 藉你裂开宝贵身体
1 藉你裂开宝贵身体，  进入幔内； 
 罪人听见何等信息，  进入幔内。 
 你用宝血来买回我；  完全的爱来寻回我；  圣洁羔羊来带回我 -   进入幔内。 
2 出到营外；
 被神所弃，被人所害 -   出到营外。 
 惟你宝贵十架感我；  如今羞辱不再吓我；  欢然跟随，无何害我 -   出到营外。 
3 进入幔内。
 蒙你洗净，坦然无惧 -   进入幔内。 
 成为新造，毫无罪痕：  完全救恩今属我们；  我们谦卑，俯伏感恩 -   进入幔内。 
4 出到营外；
 快步向前，无所畏惧 -   出到营外。 
 你的羞辱是我至宝，  远甚埃及所夸财宝；  莫测大爱将我感召 -   出到营外。 
5 在幔子里。
 不再离散，与你合一 -   在幔子里。 
 无何能使你我分离；  亲眼见你，不再忧虑；  “赞美羔羊！”  
 永不止息 - 在幔子里。 
498 THROUGH THY PRECIOUS BODY BROKEN
1 Through Thy precious body broken —  
 Inside the veil; 
 Oh! what words to sinners spoken —  
 Inside the veil. 
 Precious as the blood that bought us; 
 Perfect, as the love that sought us; 
 Holy, as the Lamb that brought us —  
 Inside the veil. 
2 When we see Thy love unshaken —  
 Outside the camp. 
 Scorned by man, by God forsaken —  
 Outside the camp. 
 Thy loved cross alone can charm us; 
 Shame need now no more alarm us; 
 Glad we follow, nought can harm us —  
 Outside the camp. 
3 Lamb of God, through Thee we enter —  
 Inside the veil. 
 Cleansed by Thee, we boldly venture —  
 Inside the veil. 
 Not a stain; a new creation: 
 Ours is such a full salvation; 
 Low we bow in adoration —  
 Inside the veil.  
4 Unto Thee, the homeless stranger —  
 Outside the camp, 
 Forth we hasten, fear no danger —  
 Outside the camp. 
 Thy reproach, far richer treasure 
 Than all Egypt’s boasted pleasure; 
 Drawn by love that knows no measure —  
 Outside the camp. 
5 Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered —  
 Inside the veil. 
 All with Thee — no more be scattered —  
 Inside the veil. 
 Nought from Thee, our hearts shall sever; 
 We shall see Thee; grieve Thee never; 
 “Praise the Lamb!” shall sound forever —  
 Inside the veil.
499 哦在荣耀里的基督
1 哦，在荣耀里的基督，  已将我心全照亮；  非像微星暗中光顾，  乃是明光胜太阳。  地上全是黑暗、阴影，  无何能以得我心，  惟祂所行艰苦途径，  值得我心来宝珍。 
2 世人乃靠属地之光，  艰苦疲困度人生；  我见之光来自天上，  远胜午日放光明：  毫无遮蔽，永不衰亏，  使我得见祂荣面，  和祂爱的无限宝贵，  并祂恩典的丰满。 
3 得见祂的奇妙荣耀，  并祂更妙的奇爱：  如何为我已经得到  高超地位到万代。  幔子已撤，非仅一瞥，  乃是幔内来安居；  注视祂面无间无歇，  得听隐密的话语。 
4 我已看见基督荣面，  别事请勿向我题；  我已听见祂的恩言，  这已够使我满意。  藉祂荣耀所发光辉，  有福荣面我已见，  这个荣耀且要成为  我的住处到永远。 
499 MARVEL NOT THAT CHRIST IN GLORY
1 Marvel not that Christ in glory 
 All my inmost heart hath won; 
 Not a star to cheer my darkness, 
 But a light beyond the sun. 
 All below lies dark and shadowed, 
 Nothing here to claim my heart, 
 Save the lonely track of sorrow 
 Where of old He walked apart. 
2 Others in the earthly sunshine 
 Wearily may journey on, 
 I have seen a light from heaven 
 Past the brightness of the sun —  
 Light that knows no cloud, no waning, 
 Light wherein I see His face, 
 All His love’s uncounted treasures, 
 All the riches of His grace: 
3 All the wonders of His glory, 
 Deeper wonders of His love —  
 How for me He won, He keepeth 
 That high standing all above; 
 Not a glimpse — the veil uplifted —  
 But within the veil to dwell, 
 Gazing on His face forever, 
 Hearing words unspeakable. 
4 I have seen the face of Jesus —  
 Tell me not of aught beside; 
 I have heard the voice of Jesus —  
 All my soul is satisfied. 
 In the radiance of the glory 
 First I saw His blessed face, 
 And forever shall that glory 
 Be my home, my dwelling-place.

 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 Which did once God’s light conceal, 
 O glory be to God! 
 But the blood has brought me in 
 To God’s holiness so clean, 
 Where there’s death to self and sin, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
4 I’m within the holiest pale, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 I have passed the inner veil, 
 O glory be to God! 
 I am sanctified to God 
 By the power of the blood, 
 Now the Lord is my abode, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb!
501 我有一位好朋友 特.

 祂是爱我如此温柔，  祂爱非常甜美； 
 我不能活无祂之处，  我爱祂的提握； 
 所以我们就同住，  我主与我。 
2 有时我几乎卧倒，  祂知我的软弱， 
 当祂叫我向祂倚靠，  我乐受祂扶托； 
 祂带我走光明途径，  日过光明生活； 
 所以我们就同行，  我主与我。 
3 祂知我爱祂几多，  祂知我爱浅深； 
 但祂是用何爱爱我，  我永不能说清； 
 乃是一爱永远不衰，  越过越像热火； 
 所以彼此就相爱，  我主与我。 
4 我告祂以我痛苦，  告祂以我欢喜； 
 我告祂以我所羡慕，  告祂以我刺激； 
 祂告我以所当策励，  告我以所当作； 
 我们彼此吐心意，  我主与我。

 祂就叫我为祂外出，  去报爱的新闻； 
 祂叫我说祂的奇爱，  并祂受死经过； 
 我们如此常同在，  我主与我。 
6 祂告我以祂国度  离此并不太远； 
 祂心切望能够尽速  把我带到那边； 
 无终幸福，喜乐在望，  还有荣耀宝座， 
不久我们同作王， 
 我主与我。 
501 I HAVE A FRIEND SO PRECIOUS IRREGULAR METER
1 I have a Friend so precious, 
 So very dear to me, 
 He loves me with such tender love, 
 He loves so faithfully; 
 I could not live apart from Him, 
 I love to feel Him nigh, 
 And so we dwell together, 
 My Lord and I. 
2 Sometimes I’m faint and weary, 
 He knows that I am weak, 
 And as He bids me lean on Him, 
 His help I gladly seek; 
 He leads me in the paths of light, 
 Beneath a sunny sky, 
 And so we walk together, 
 My Lord and I. 
3 He knows how much I love Him, 
 He knows I love Him well; 
 But with what love He loveth me 
 My tongue can never tell; 
 It is an everlasting love 
 In ever rich supply, 
 And so we love each other, 
 My Lord and I. 
4 I tell Him all my sorrows, 
 I tell Him all my joys, 
 I tell Him all that pleases me, 
 I tell Him what annoys; 
 He tells me what I ought to do, 
 He tells me how to try, 
 And so we talk together, 
 My Lord and I. 
5 He knows how I am longing 
 Some weary soul to win, 
 And so He bids me go and speak 
 The loving Word for Him; 
 He bids me tell His wondrous love, 
 And why He came to die, 
 And so we work together, 
 My Lord and I. 
6 He tells me of His Kingdom, 
 It is not far away; 
 And oh, His heart is longing 
 To take me there some day. 
 Immortal bliss is waiting 
 And joys that never die: 
 Soon there we’ll reign together, 
 My Lord and I.

502 SAVIOR I BY FAITH AM TOUCHING
1 Savior, I by faith am touching 
 Thee, the source of every good; 
 Virtue now, by faith am claiming, 
 Through the cleansing of Thy blood. 
(C) Touching Thee, new life is glowing 
 By Thy Spirit’s burning flame; 
 Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling, 
 Glory to Thy Holy Name! 
2 Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee 
 In Thy riches full and free; 
 All I am I open to Thee, 
 All Thou art Thou giv’st to me. 
3 Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,  O most mighty King of kings; 
 Of Thy fulness now receiving, 
 High I mount on eagle wings. 
4 Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom, 
 All my need, by Thee supplied; 
 Keep me touching, keep me claiming, 
 Keep me ever at Thy side.
503 我主你说你是真树
1 我主，你说你是真树，  我是你的真枝子；  但我不知为何缘故，  我是如此不结实。 
2 我心羡慕结果更多，  更能彰显你生命；  更能荣耀归与宝座，  更能祷告得答应。 
3 但是，主阿，我不明白  “常在里面”的圣言；  我越追求要去”常在”，  我越发现在外边。 
4 我不觉得我在里面，  也祷告并立志！ 
 但你都像隔开很远，  生命仍然无果子。 
5 但你是说，你已是树，  我也已是你枝子；  当我信你作我救主，  圣灵已成此事实。 
6 我今已是在你里面，  再也不必求加入；  我是已经与你结联，  完全合一的骨肉。 
7 秘诀不是要我”去在”，  事实是我”已在”内；  所求乃是不要离开，  不是如何得地位。 
8 我已在内，已在你内！  这是神作的事实！  不必祷告，不必行为，  乃是神手的设施。 
9 我已在内怎求入内！  我是何等的愚昧，  现今我只欢乐赞美，  相信圣言的无伪。 
10 我今只有完全安息，  知道你是我一切，  你是生命、你是能力，  而我一切都了结。 
503 THOU HAST SAID THOU ART THE VINE  LORD
1 Thou hast said Thou art the Vine, Lord, 
 And that I’m a branch in Thee, 
 But I do not know the reason 
 Why I should so barren be. 
2 Bearing fruit is my deep longing, 
 More Thy life to manifest, 
 To Thy throne to bring more glory, 
 That Thy will may be expressed. 
3 But I fail to understand, Lord, 
 What it means — “abide in me” 
 For the more I seek “abiding,” 
 More I feel I’m not in Thee. 
4 How I feel I’m not abiding; 
 Though I pray and strongly will, 
 Yet from me Thou seemest distant 
 And my life is barren still. 
5 Yet Thou art the Vine, Thou saidst it. 
 And I am a branch in Thee; 
 When I take Thee as my Savior, 
 Then this fact is wrought in me. 
6 Now I’m in Thee and I need not 
 Seek into Thyself to come, 
 For I’m joined to Thee already, 
 With Thy flesh and bones I’m one. 
7 Not to “go in” is the secret, 
 But that I’m “already in”! 
 That I ne’er may leave I’d ask Thee. 
 Not how I may get within. 
8 I am in, already in Thee! 
 What a place to which I’m brought! 
 There’s no need for prayer or struggling, 
 God Himself the work has wrought. 
9 Since I’m in, why ask to enter; 
 O how ignorant I’ve been! 
 Now with praise and much rejoicing 
 For Thy Word, I dwell therein. 
10 Now in Thee I rest completely, 
 With myself I gladly part; 
 Thou art life and Thou art power, 
 All in all to me Thou art.
504 住在你里面这是我心愿
1 住在你里面，这是我心愿，  住在你里面，时刻不间断；  枝子如何与葡萄树相联，  我也深愿，主，住在你里面。 
2 住在你里面，你富我享受，  你所是一切，得藉我流露；  愿作你身上常新的枝子，  彰显你生命，结果永不止。 
3 住在你里面，罪、已失权能，  再无法胜过你内住生命；  与你相结联，深处互交通，  灵就能管治魂一切活动。 
4 住在你里面，得知你心意，  摸着你同在，进入你秘密；  喜乐与平安要将我充溢，  你话的供应也作我能力。 
504 ABIDE IN THEE IN THAT DEEP LOVE OF  THINE
1 Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine, 
 My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine, 
 Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,  I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee. 
2 Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know 
 How love of Thine so vast in me may flow, 
 My empty vessel, running o’er with joy, 
 Must overflow to Thee without alloy. 
3 Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin, 
 Can e’er prevail with Thy blest life within; 
 Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul 
 Knows naught besides its motions to control. 
4 Abide in Thee! ‘tis thus I only know 
 The secrets of Thy mind e’en while below —  
 All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,  All pow’r and fruit, and service for the Lord.

 He’s the rich indwelling Word; 
 To abide we must be faithful 
 To the speaking that we’ve heard. 
3 For ‘tis here we know abiding 
 In the real and deepest way; 
 If we love our Lord completely, 
 We would do whate’er He’d say. 
4 Then His love abides within us, 
 And in love abiding, we 
 Know the joy of life-communion, 
 Full and perfect harmony. 
5 Oh, how precious this abiding, 
 Oh, how intimate and sweet; 
 As the fruit of life is added, 
 And our joy is made complete.

1 I have learned the wondrous secret 
 Of abiding in the Lord;

 And His faith, and life, and love.

 For my works His Spirit’s power; 
 For my ways His ceaseless presence 
 Guards and guides me every hour. 
 Of my heart, He is the portion, 
 Of my joy the boundless spring;

 Glorious Lord, and coming King.

 Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

 Of Thy life, that all may see 
 Thine own resurrection power 
 Mightily put forth in me;

 Yet more consciously Thy home.

1 我知救主永活不已，  长远为我代求； 
 祂所赐给爱的表记，  确保我得自由。 
2 我知我救赎主活着，  祂是赐生命灵； 
 祂将永远生命赐我，  恩典真是宽宏！ 
3 祂使我能抬起头来，  亲身带下救恩， 
 我得自由因祂同在，  不久祂要再临。 
4 祂还定意使我成圣，  谁能与祂抗争？ 
 恩典在我心中规正，  使祂旨意完成。 
5 主，我对你圣洁话语，  坚定相信投倚； 
 你必再来，且要宣布  我是完全属你！ 
515 I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES
1 I know that my Redeemer lives 
 And ever prays for me; 
 A token of His love He gives, 
 A pledge of liberty. 
2 I know that my Redeemer lives, 
 A quick’ning Spirit He; 
 I know eternal life He gives —  
 Amazing grace — to me. 
3 I find Him lifting up my head; 
 He brings salvation near; 
 His presence makes me free indeed, 
 And He will soon appear. 
4 He wills that I should holy be: 
 What can withstand His will? 
 The counsel of His grace in me 
 He surely shall fulfill. 
5 Jesus, I hang upon Thy word: 
 I steadfastly believe 
 Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord, 
 And to Thyself receive.
516 主你的应许我全都接受
1 主，你的应许，我全都接受，  每天来取用，长阔又深厚；  面对着将来，我毫无畏惧，  因为我救主，与我永不离。 
2 时日会改迁，得失难预测，  景色常更换，幻梦易失色；  亲爱的救主，我心感谢你，  因你永不会把我来丢弃。 
3 前面的年日，艰苦或黑暗，  阴府的权势，罪恶的试探，  纵在黑暗中，我心仍安详，  因在阴影中，你仍在我旁。 
4 有时喜乐潮，充满在我心，  地上的美景，天上的光明，  勿让我留此，仍来亲近你，  不再停他处，只在你怀里。 
5 愿我的一生留下的年日，  不再求安乐，或挣扎得释，  每日的生活，恩典必加力，  人生的重荷，恩主必体恤。 
6 愿一生一世，永与主同在，  纵过死荫谷，仍不怕遭害。  当我度过这地上的年日，  仍与主同在，一直到永世。 
516 I TAKE THY PROMISE LORD IN ALL ITS  LENGTH
1 I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length, 
 And breadth and fulness, as my daily strength; 
 Into life’s future fearless I may gaze, 
 For, Savior, Thou art with me all the days. 
2 Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,  New scenes surround my life and fancies strange;  I thank Thee that no day can ever break, 
 Savior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake. 
3 There may be days of darkness and distress, 
 When sin has power to tempt, and care to press,  Yet in the darkest day I will not fear, 
 For, ‘mid the shadows, Thou wilt still be near. 
4 Days there may be of joy and.deep delight, 
 When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,  Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest 
 Elsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast. 
5 And all the other days that make my life, 
 Marked by no special joy or grief or strife, 
 Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care, 
 Burdens too small for other hearts to share; 
6 Spend Thou these days with me, all shall be Thine,  So shall the darkest hour with glory shine. 
 Then when these earthly years have passed away,  Let me be with Thee in the perfect day.
517 人若相信耶稣的名
1 人若相信耶稣的名，  在祂凡事都是可能；  主，我不再藐视你名，  你的真理欢然心领。  我心信你，我能确定；  于我凡事都是可能。 
2 一事我已确定认知，  在我里面罪无权势，  它已失败，它已失势；  主，我信靠你的信实。  对你若无一事难成，  于我凡事都是可能。 
3 地与阴府尽管反对，  神的话语永不衰退；  主能断开罪的锁炼，  虽似不能，实则必然。 
 事物似乎绝不可能，  于我凡事都是可能。 
4 在神凡事都是可能，  基督在人是神大能；  当我全人都被更新，  我在主里完全模成，  就得脱离罪的权能，  于我凡事都是可能。 
5 在神凡事都是可能，  基督在我是神大能；  全能的主，布我各处，  活着不再是我，乃主；  求你现在从我证明，  你那甜美、全能爱情。 
517 ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIM
1 All things are possible to him 
 That can in Jesus’ name-believe; 
 Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme, 
 Thy truth I lovingly receive. 
 I can, I do believe in Thee; 
 All things are possible to me. 
2 ‘Twas most impossible of all 
 That here sin’s reign in me should cease; 
 Yet shall it be, I know it shall; 
 Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness. 
 If nothing is too hard for Thee, 
 All things are possible to me. 
3 Though earth and hell the Word gainsay, 
 The Word of God shall never fail; 
 The Lord can break sin’s iron sway; 
 ‘Tis certain, though impossible. 
 The thing impossible shall be, 
 All things are possible to me. 
4 All things are possible to God; 
 To Christ, the power of God in man; 
 To me when I am all renewed, 
 In Christ am fully formed again, 
 And from the reign of sin set free, 
 All things are possible to me. 
5 All things are possible to God; 
 To Christ, the power of God in me; 
 Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad, 
 Let me no longer live, but Thee; 
 Give me this hour in Thee to prove 
 The sweet omnipotence of love.
518 耶稣我今欢然安息
1 耶稣！我今欢然安息，  因我确知你是谁；  我也领会你的爱心，  深广且甜美！ 
 你嘱咐我注目于你，  你的美丽夺我心，  借着你的变化大能，  来将我更新。 
和 耶稣！我今欢然安息，  因我确知你是谁；  我也领会你的爱心，  深广且甜美！ 
2 你的慈爱何其广大！  逾越浩瀚的海洋；  你的良善何其奇妙！  倾注我身上。 
 亲爱救主，我今安息，  因知你恩何丰富，  你的应许全都归我，  何等的稳固！ 
3 一心信靠我主耶稣，  我瞻仰你的自己，  并你的爱纯洁、不变，  满足我心意， 
 使我深处干渴得解，  供应我每一需要，  你用祝福四面环绕，  你爱真可靠。 
4 当我工作或在等你，  求用面光将我照；  你的笑容使我安息，  阴影全退消。 
 你是父荣耀的光辉，  是父脸上的丰采，  保守我心安息、信靠，  充满你恩爱。 
518 JESUS I AM RESTING RESTING
1 Jesus! I am resting, resting 
 In the joy of what Thou art; 
 I am finding out the greatness 
 Of Thy loving heart. 
 Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee, 
 And Thy beauty fills my soul, 
 For, by Thy transforming power, 
 Thou hast made me whole. 
(C) Jesus! I am resting, resting 
 In the joy of what Thou art; 
 I am finding out the greatness 
 Of Thy loving heart. 
2 Oh, how great Thy loving kindness, 
 Vaster, broader than the sea: 
 Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness, 
 Lavished all on me! 
 Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved, 
 Know what wealth of grace is Thine,  Know Thy certainty of promise, 
 And have made it mine. 
3 Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus, 
 I behold Thee as Thou art, 
 And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,  Satisfies my heart, 
 Satisfies its deepest longings, 
 Meets, supplies its every need, 
 Compasseth me round with blessings,  Thine is love indeed. 
4 Ever lift Thy face upon me, 
 As I work and wait for Thee; 
 Resting ‘neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,  Earth’s dark shadows flee. 
 Brightness of my Father’s glory, 
 Sunshine of my Father’s face, 
 Keep me ever trusting, resting, 
 Fill me with Thy grace.
519 意志薄弱能力软弱
1 意志薄弱，能力软弱，  盼望已经全都消灭；  只有信托你的工作  将我这人温柔提挈。 
2 尽我所能，仍然失败，  失败至今，失败频仍；  无何可信，信你能耐，  能够抓我听你命令。 
3 当我的心稍为高仰，  我就近乎跌倒危地；  我不敢作，我不敢想，  事事处处，我需要你。 
4 你是救主，刚强、负责，  哦主，我今寻求你面；  虽然我是弱中弱者，  我的能力是你恩典。 
519 MY WILL IS WEAK MY STRENGTH IS  FRAIL
1 My will is weak, my strength is frail, 
 And all my hope is nearly gone; 
 I can but trust Thy working true 
 To gently hold and lead me on. 
2 I’ve tried my best, but still have failed, 
 E’en as before I’ve failed and erred; 
 Thy patience is my only trust 
 To hold and keep me to Thy word. 
3 Whene’er my heart is lifted up, 
 How very near I am to fall; 
 I dare not do, I dare not think, 
 I need Thyself in great or small. 
4 Thou art my Savior, strength and stay, 
 O Lord, I come to seek Thy face; 
 Though I’m the weakest of the weak, 
 My strength is nothing but Thy grace.
520 主我心安息于你
1 主，我心安息于你， 
 这才是真安息； 
 全能救主，除了你， 
 罪人有何所需？ 
 你亮光是我智慧， 
 你爱是我安慰； 
 你在荣耀里再临， 
 今日比昨日近。 
和 主，我心安息于你，这才是真安息；  全能救主，除了你， 
 何为罪人所需？ 
 罪人有何所需？ 
2 你深知我罪甚多， 
 你赐怜悯更多； 
 你是无瑕的牺牲， 
 你死使我得生。 
 因你，我锁炼脱落， 
 从灰尘中复活； 
 你宝血是我至宝， 
 你话何等何靠。 
3 借着我，温柔的主， 
 成就你的意图； 
 我愿永远不悖逆， 
 你的至圣旨意。 
 虽然我是极软弱， 
 能力并不在我； 
 你儿女中最无者， 
 有你就有一切。 
4 当黑云最暗、最深， 
 正是我主最近， 
 复苏我枯萎信心， 
 激励我的疲魂。 
 安然藏身你胸间， 
 我注目你笑脸； 
 仇敌虽尽其全力， 
 不能将我驱离。 
5 是你使我心欢畅， 
 是你将我释放； 
 惟你永远配得着， 
 荣耀并我讴歌。 
 今世的爱与福分， 
 不久都要耗尽， 
 你恩仍与我相伴， 
 无论生死不变。 
520 ON THEE MY HEART IS RESTING
1 On Thee my heart is resting, 
 Ah, this is rest indeed: 
 What else, Almighty Savior, 
 Can a poor sinner need? 
 Thy light is all my wisdom, 
 Thy love is all my stay; 
 Thy coming back in glory, 
 Draws nearer every day. 
(C) On Thee my heart is resting, 
 Ah, this is rest indeed: 
 What else, Almighty Savior, 
 Can a poor sinner need? 
2 My guilt is great, but greater 
 The mercy Thou dost give; 
 Thyself, a spotless Off’ring, 
 Hast died that I should live. 
 With Thee, my soul unfettered 
 Has risen from the dust; 
 Thy blood is all my treasure, 
 Thy word is all my trust. 
3 Through me, Thou gentle Master, 
 Thy purposes fulfil; 
 I yield myself forever 
 To Thy most holy will. 
 What though I be but weakness? 
 My strength is not in me; 
 The poorest of Thy people 
 Has all things, having Thee. 
4 When clouds are darkest round me, 
 Thou, Lord, art then most near,  
 My drooping faith to quicken, 
 My weary soul to cheer. 
 Safe nestling in Thy bosom, 
 I gaze upon Thy face; 
 In vain my foes would drive me 
 From Thee, my hiding-place. 
5 ‘Tis Thou hast made me happy, 
 ‘Tis Thou hast set me free; 
 To whom shall I give glory 
 Forever, but to Thee? 
 Of earthly love and blessing 
 Should every stream run dry, 
 Thy grace shall still be with me, 
 Thy grace, to live and die.
521 当我同主行动
1 当我同主行动， 
 在祂话的光中， 
 何等荣耀，照亮我路程；  当我肯听命令， 
 祂就充满我灵， 
 祂充满信而顺从的人。 
和 信而顺从！ 
 因为除此以外， 
 不能得主的喜爱 -   惟有信而顺从！ 
2 地无一点黑影、 
 天无一片暗景 
 能迷漫，当祂显露笑容；  没有疑惑、畏惧、 
 没有流泪、忧虑 
 能存在，若我信而顺从。 
3 没有一个重担、 
 没有一点为难， 
 祂是不顾，让我们苦痛；  所有伤心、损失、 
 所有厌弃、羞耻 
 都成祝福，若信而顺从。 
4 但我不能领会 
 祂爱何等的美， 
 若我不放一切于坛社；  因祂所给诗歌、 
 因祂所赐喜乐， 
 乃是为肯信而顺从者。 
5 然后在祂光中， 
 才有甜美交通， 
 我就前行，跟随祂脚踪；  祂要求，我就许； 
 祂差遣，我就去； 
 不要怕，只要信而顺从。 
521 WHEN WE WALK WITH THE LORD
1 When we walk with the Lord 
 In the light of His Word, 
 What a glory He sheds on our way; 
 While we do His good will, 
 He abides with us still, 
 And with all who will trust and obey. 
(C) Trust and obey, 
 For there’s no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus, 
 But to trust and obey. 
2 Not a shadow can rise, 
 Not a cloud in the skies, 
 But His smile quickly drives it away; 
 Not a doubt or a fear, 
 Not a sigh or a tear, 
 Can abide while we trust and obey. 
3 Not a burden we bear, 
 Not a sorrow we share, 
 But our toil He doth richly repay; 
 Not a grief or a loss, 
 Not a frown or a cross, 
 But is blest if we trust and obey. 
4 But we never can prove 
 The delights of His love, 
 Until all on the altar we lay; 
 For the favor He shows, 
 And the joy He bestows, 
 Are for them who will trust and obey. 
5 Then in fellowship sweet 
 We will sit at His feet, 
 Or we’ll walk by His side in the way; 
 What He says we will do; 
 Where He sends, we will go, 
 Never fear, only trust and obey.
522 不论何处耶稣同行放心去
1 不论何处，耶稣同行，放心去！  祂引领我，行走世途，可无虑。  若无祂的同在，一切无乐趣，  不论何处，耶稣同在，可无惧！ 
和 在这里，在那里，我都不恐惧！  不论何处，耶稣同在，放心去！ 
2 不论何处，耶稣同在，不孤单，  朋友虽远离我，耶稣常作伴。  祂亲手领我，路途虽然艰难，  不论何处，耶稣同在，就甘甜。 
3 不论何处，耶稣同在，可安睡，  虽阴影笼罩，我心并不惧畏；  因知我将醒来，永不再徘徊，  不论何处，耶稣同在，何甜美。 
522 ANYWHERE WITH JESUS I CAN SAFELY  GO
11.11.11.11. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, 
 Anywhere He leads me in this world below, 
 Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;  Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid. 
(C) Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know. 
 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go. 
2 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone, 
 Other friends may fail me, He is still my own. 
 Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,  Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise. 
3 Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep, 
 When the darkling shadows round about me creep;  Knowing I shall waken never more to roam, 
 Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
523 祂带领我此意何美
1 祂带领我，此意何美！  此言充满天上安慰！  处处、事事、所是、所作，  都有主手来带领我。 
和 祂带领我，祂带领我，  祂是亲手在带领我；  任何境遇，我都随着，  因祂亲手在带领我。 
2 有时似堕痛苦深渊，  有时似在快乐伊甸；  或遇平顺，或遭风波，  都有主手来带领我。 
3 主阿，愿你紧握我手，  领我一生随你而走；  是福是苦由你定夺，  只要你手来带领我。 
4 等我行完今生路程，  靠你恩典完全得胜；  死河寒波我亦不躲，  因你至终亲手领我。 
523 HE LEADETH ME O BLESSED THOUGHT
1 He leadeth me! O blessed thought, 
 O words with heav’nly comfort fraught; 
 Whate’er I do, where’er I be, 
 Still ‘tis Christ’s hand that leadeth me. 
(C) He leadeth me! He leadeth me! 
 By His own hand He leadeth me; 
 His faithful follower I would be, 
 For by His hand He leadeth me. 
2 Sometimes ‘mid scenes of deepest gloom, 
 Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, 
 By waters still, o’er troubled sea, 
 Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me. 
3 Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, 
 Nor ever murmur or repine; 
 Content, whatever lot I see, 
 Since it is Thou that leadest me. 
4 And when my task on earth is done, 
 When, by Thy grace, the vict’ry’s won, 
 E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee, 
 Since Thou in triumph leadest me.
524 神在天上有一宝贝
1 神在天上有一宝贝，  丰富无人能言述； 
 永远心爱、无价宝贵，  就是祂子主基督。  神在地上有一宝贝，  价值惟有神知悉； 
 莫测大爱人难测窥 -   基督启示我心里。 
2 神藉火焰舌头临到，  用这永远无穷尽、  取用不竭的无价宝，  充满所选的器皿。  神从天上荣耀里头，  亲来充满这器皿， 
 用祂爱的无限富有，  满足所有渴慕心。 
3 虽受折磨、试炼、试探，  荣耀呼召仍属你； 
 葡萄树枝与树相联，  向主倒空你自己。  泥土器皿世人鄙视，  软弱、贫穷又卑贱，  装着宝贝神心赏识，  将主荣耀来彰显。 
4 愿我更加倒空、谦卑，  不为人知、不显扬，  作神器皿，更圣、更贵，  充满基督的荣光！ 
 无何地物遮此荣光，  也无自己的遮蔽， 
 将这奇妙故事宣扬，  倒空、充满祂自己。 
524 GOD IN HEAVEN HATH A TREASURE
1 God in heaven hath a treasure, 
 Riches none may count or tell; 
 Hath a deep eternal pleasure, 
 Christ the Son, He loveth well. 
 God hath here on earth a treasure, 
 None but He its price may know —  
 Deep, unfathomable pleasure, 
 Christ revealed in saints below. 
2 God in tongues of fire descending, 
 Chosen vessels thus to fill 
 With the treasure never ending, 
 Ever spent — unfailing still. 
 God’s own hand the vessel filling 
 From the glory far above, 
 Longing hearts forever stilling 
 With the riches of His love. 
3 Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,  Glorious calling, saint, is thine; 
 Let the Lord but find thee emptied, 
 Living branch in Christ the Vine! 
 Vessels of the world’s despising, 
 Vessels weak and poor and base, 
 Bearing wealth God’s heart is prizing, 
 Glory from Christ’s blessed face. 
4 Oh to be but emptier, lowlier, 
 Mean, unnoticed — and unknown, 
 And to God a vessel holier, 
 Filled with Christ and Christ alone! 
 Naught of earth to cloud the glory, 
 Naught of self the light to dim, 
 Telling forth His wondrous story, 
 Emptied to be filled with Him.
525 非我惟主被人高举并爱敬
1 非我惟主，被人高举并爱敬；  非我惟主，被人传扬、相信；  非我惟主，显在言语和步武；  非我惟主，显在思想、态度。 
和 哦，求主救我脱离自己！  失去在你里面！ 
 哦，但愿不再是自己，  惟主活我里面！ 
2 非我惟主，是我一切的起首；  非我惟主，是供给的源头；  非我惟主，是我所为而工作；  非我惟主，是我所为生活。 
3 主，惟有主，所以不再有闲言；  主，惟有主，所以不再自怜；  主，惟有主，所以不再为自己；  主，惟有主，所以不再自义。 
4 非我惟主，故无一可以自傲；  非我惟主，故无一可自暴；  非我惟主，因此不再有重担；  非我惟主，因此不怕危难。 
5 主，惟有主，不久充满我眼睛，  荣耀无比，不久就要显明；  主，惟有主，要永受我的感谢，  耶稣基督，要永是我一切。 
525 NOT I BUT CHRIST BE HONORED LOVED  EXALTED
11.10.11.10. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted, 
 Not I, but Christ be seen, be known and heard; 
 Not I, but Christ in every look and action, 
 Not I, but Christ in every thought and word. 
(C) Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord, 
 Oh, to be lost in Thee, 
 Oh, that it may be no more I, 
 But Christ that lives in me. 
2 Not I, but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow, 
 Not I, but Christ to wipe the falling tear; 
 Not I, but Christ to lift the weary burden, 
 Not I, but Christ to hush away all fear. 
3 Christ, only Christ, no idle word e’er falling, 
 Christ, only Christ, no needless bustling sound; 
 Christ, only Christ, no self-important bearing, 
 Christ, only Christ, no trace of I be found. 
4 Not I, but Christ my every need supplying, 
 Not I, but Christ my strength and health to be; 
 Christ, only Christ, for spirit, soul, and body, 
 Christ, only Christ, live then Thy life in me. 
5 Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision, 
 Glory excelling soon, full soon I’ll see; 
 Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling, 
 Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.\ 
526 神照祂形像造人
1 神照祂形像造人，  好让祂充满； 
 人就成祂模成品，  这是祂心愿！ 
 是的，人有神样式，  形像也相称， 
 神的生命和所是，  祂都要模成！ 
2 亚当生命如树果，  含树的本质； 
 人受造将神得着 -   何等的价值！ 
 人确是神的容器，  祂如此设计， 
 神人美德真一律，  人与神合一 
3 但人堕落，形像毁；  容器成空虚。 
 基督救赎来挽回：  神旨不废去。 
 救主耶稣神而人 -   神形像何真： 
 神、人性质集一身，  来住你我身。 
4 人若常住祂里面，  祂就会加添； 
 生命美德渐充满，  透过人显现！ 
 那时，人有神样式，  形像也相称， 
 神的生命和所是，  祂都已模成。 
526 IN GOD’S IMAGE WE WERE MADE
1 In God’s image we were made; 
 Made for Him to fill, 
 Thus Himself to duplicate, and 
 Duplicate He will! 
 “In God’s image,” yes, indeed —  
 Matching ev’ry trait. 
 All His inner life and being 
 He will duplicate! 
2 Adam’s life was like a cone 
 To contain the Tree; 
 Man was made to take in God —  
 What capacity! 
 God’s container, yes, indeed! 
 Thus He did design 
 All the human virtues to be 
 Filled with the divine. 
3 Lost, the image, through man’s fall; 
 Lost, the life to fill. 
 But — recovered! — Christ is all: 
 God will do it still. 
 Christ our Savior — God and Man —  
 Is God’s image tree: 
 Human virtues, life divine 
 Dwell in me and you. 
4 As we spend more time with Him, 
 He will spread in us; 
 Virtues filled with life within: 
 Image glorious! 
 We will match Him — yes, indeed; 
 Match His every trait! 
 All His inner life and being 
 He will duplicate!
527 主我所盼望所切慕
1 主，我所盼望、所切慕，  乃是基督能显大； 
 无论生死，无论乐苦，  叫我持守不偏差。 
和 主，没有一事能叫我羞愧，  虽损失、艰苦并难为，  凡事仍叫基督照常显出，  生命借着十架流露。 
2 这事藉众圣徒祈祷， 
 并全备之灵帮助， 
 完全救恩终必达到！ 
 这见证何等丰足。 
3 主，你虚己，存心顺服，  竟死在十字架上； 
 被神升高，万膝拜服，  何等完美的榜样。 
4 何等有福，今这榜样，  已作到我的心里！ 
 卑微受死，高升天上，  如此奇恩真希奇。 
5 故当作成得救工夫， 
 因我们立志行事， 
 乃神运行心里之故， 
 为要成就祂美旨。 
6 我们就能无可指摘， 
 好像明光来照耀， 
 在这弯曲悖谬时刻， 
 表明出生命之道。 
7 要在主里行事为人， 
 与基督福音相称； 
 同心努力，同灵站稳，  成为耶稣的见证。 
527 LORD OUR EARNEST EXPECTATION
1 Lord, our earnest expectation 
 Is that Christ be magnified, 
 And in all our circumstances 
 Universally applied. 
(C) Lord, in nothing will we be ashamed, 
 Though in suffering, hardship, loss, 
 But in all things Christ shall be expressed,  Life shall triumph through the cross! 
2 This shall turn to our salvation, 
 Through the Spirit bountiful 
 And the prayers of all the members, 
 For a testimony full. 
3 Lord, we praise You for the pattern 
 Of a living crucified, 
 And the Father’s exaltation 
 Of Yourself so qualified. 
4 O how blest, this living pattern 
 Now is being wrought in ust 
 Crucifixion, exaltation —  
 Our salvation marvelous. 
5 We will work out our salvation 
 Through the operating God, 
 Through the willing and the working 
 Wrought within us by the Lord. 
6 Then we’ll blameless be and guileless, 
 Shining in the world as light, 
 In a crooked generation 
 Holding forth the word of life. 
7 Let us stand firm in one spirit, 
 Always striving with one soul, 
 That for Jesus’ testimony 
 God through us may reach His goal.
528 神照祂的形像造人
1 神照祂的形像造人，  叫人在地上代表神；  创造说出神的心意：  神要藉人彰显自己，  藉此祂叫万有周详：  神就是爱，神就是光；  公义法则、圣洁性情，  藉人发表，藉人显明。
2 因人堕落，人性受污；  神的器皿，破坏、玷污。  神差基督，作人救主；  人性美德，复原如初。  祂来作人，拔高人性；  更以神性，充实、坚定。  神被显出，充分无比；  并且又来，住人心里！ 
3 祂之所是，作我供应；  神的心愿，藉祂达成：  通过我们，复原人性，  祂的自己，得以显明。  神性丰盛，祂里积蓄；  祂这种子，我们所需；  祂被种在我们心里， 
 将祂美德分赐无遗。 
4 我们天天将祂瞻仰，  圣灵作工在我身上：  祂要更新内里各部，  模成祂形，完全无误。 
 故当抓住每一时机，  将祂人性尽情吸取；  好让圣灵更新变化，  直到我们完全像祂。 
528 WHEN GOD CREATED MAN ON EARTH
1 When God created man on earth, 
 He by His image gave 
 His treasure in creation see: 
 His image in humanity. 
 That God is love could then be known; 
 That He is light would then be 
 His holy nature, righteous ways 
 Would shine in men through all their days. 
2 The fall these human virtues soiled; 
 God’s vessel then seemed hopeless, spoiled.  But Christ, the God-Man-Savior came 
 These human virtues to reclaim. 
 He lived a human life so fine, 
 Strengthened and filled with life divine, 
 Expressing God in every part, 
 Then came to dwell within our heart!  
3 Now He is all that we require 
 That God may have His heart’s desire: 
 Himself expressed in mankind see 
 Through our restored humanity. 
 Yes, He is everything we need 
 The image-reproducing seed; 
 He’s now been sown into our heart, 
 His human virtues to impart. 
4 If we behold Him every day, 
 He’ll as the Spirit have His way: 
 Our inward parts He will transform, 
 And to His image us conform. 
 Take every opportunity 
 To drink of His humanity; 
 Transforming Spirit to bring in 
 Until we shine, expressing Him.
529 每当我们享受恩主
1 每当我们享受恩主， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 每一杯都注满溢出， 
 丰富供应我所需。 
 既不狭窄，也无不够， 
 流自祂丰富宝库； 
 祂赐我们十足升斗，上尖下流不停住。  祂赐我们十足升斗，上尖下流不停住。 
2 每当我们从父领受， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 心存感谢，享受所有， 
 赞美祂顾我所需。 
 满足、全备、深厚、丰富， 
 我所需祂都供应， 
 每当我心尝到耶稣， 总是满足我衷情。  每当我心尝到耶稣，总是满足我衷情。 
3 每当我们分享主爱， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 阔、长、深、高，无法明白， 
 远超过我们所需。 
 我们嘴唇无法述尽， 祂所有奇妙柔爱；  我们只有希奇、感恩，赞美祂名到万代。  我们只有希奇、感恩， 
 赞美祂名到万代。 
529 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING OVER
1 There is always something over, 
 When we taste our gracious Lord; 
 Every cup He fills o’erfloweth, 
 Rich supply He doth afford. 
 Nothing narrow, nothing stinted, 
 Ever issued from His store; 
 To His own He gives full measure, 
 Running over, evermore. 
2 There is always something over, 
 When we, from the Father’s hand, 
 Take our portion with thanksgiving, 
 Praising for the things He planned. 
 Satisfaction, full and deepening, 
 All our need He doth supply, 
 When the heart has tasted Jesus 
 Its desires to satisfy. 
3 There is always something over, 
 When we share in all His love; 
 Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us, 
 Unscaled heights rise far above. 
 Human lips can never utter 
 All His wondrous tenderness. 
 We can only praise and wonder 
 And His Name forever bless.

 And the night is almost gone:  Overcome! 
 Praise the Lord we have an ear,   In the church life we can hear  Jesus calling very clear: 
 Overcome! 
(C) Overcome! Overcome! 
 By obeying what He’s saying,  Overcome! 
 All our oldness cast away 
 Through the Body-life today.  He will soon be here to stay:  Overcome!

531 从黑暗死亡和苦闷的深渊
1 从黑暗、死亡和苦闷的深渊，  主将我提升到祂宝座前；  不再受撒但权势奴役、欺骗，  与主一同超越，在祂身边。 
2 涌出有福释放，成就有余。
3 从惧怕、受压和失望的深谷，  兴起喜乐，受恩典的鼓舞；  与基督同作王，豫尝祂满足；  与祂同席，新郎荣脸得睹。 
531 OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS  DEATH AND ANGUISH
1 Out of the depths of darkness, death, and anguish,  Christ lifted me and brought me to His throne.  No more enslaved by Satan’s dark delusions,  With Christ transcendent, I am His alone. 
2 Out of the depths of weakness and frustration,  Set on the mount of praise and perfect peace;  Resting in Him, I know the sweet fulfillment  Of life within that flows in blest release. 
3 Out of the depths of fear and disappointment,  Set on the mount of splendor, joy, and grace;  Reigning with Christ, I taste His satisfaction;  Feasting with Him, I glimpse the Bridegroom’s face.
532 基督是恩典从那源头 - 天父而来

 How glorious! 
 （Sisters:） In the light When this light

 （Brothers:） He’s dispelling; we’re expressing;  （Everyone:） And we’re righteous, as God, 
 in everything!
534 我神我爱我的永分
1 我神、我爱、我的永分， 
 你永是我一切； 
 你外，在天我有何人， 
 在地有你无缺！在地有你无缺！ 
2 天上一切尽都空虚， 
 地上更是如此！ 
 并无一物值得欢娱， 
 能与我神相似， 
 能与我神相似。 
3 你是我的财富、生命， 
 我的安稳住处； 
 其他事物，我虽感领， 
 但非我神、我主，但非我神、我主。 
4 闪耀财富，与你相比， 
 不过虚空玩具！ 
 何况其他人之所倚， 
 岂不更将人愚？ 岂不更将人愚？ 
5 即使全地归我为业， 
 群星也是我的， 
 若无你作我的一切， 
 我仍可怜至极！我仍可怜至极！ 
6 让人伸臂如同大海， 
 笼罗一切财富； 
 但我只要你的同在， 
 此外无所爱慕，此外无所爱慕。 
534 MY GOD MY PORTION AND MY LOVE
1 My God, my Portion, and my Love, 
 My everlasting All, 
 I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above, 
 Or on this earthly ball, Or on this earthly ball. 
2 What empty things are all the skies, 
 And this inferior clod! 
 There’s nothing here deserves my joys, 
 There’s nothing like my God, 
 There’s nothing like my God. 
3 To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends, 
 And health, and safe abode; 
 Thanks to Thy name for meaner things, 
 But they are not my God, But they are not my God. 
4 How vain a toy is glittering wealth, 
 If once compared to’ Thee! 
 Or what’s my safety, or my health, 
 Or all my friends to me, Or all my friends to me. 
5 Were I possessor of the earth, 
 And called the stars my own, 
 Without Thy graces and Thyself, 
 I were a wretch undone, I were a wretch undone. 
6 Let others stretch their arms like seas, 
 And grasp in all the shore; 
 Grant me the visits of Thy grace, 
 And I desire no more, And I desire no more.
535 永恒之光永恒之光
1 是灵、爱和光
1 永恒之光！永恒之光！  光照、鉴察我里， 
 将我净化，使我明亮；  面对这光，我心安详，  因我得以见你。 
2 围绕宝座天上众灵，  虽可同沐光明， 
 但是他们仅仅享用；  堕落世界痛苦光景，  他们绝不知情。 
3 像我生性愚昧昏蒙，  又居黑暗之中， 
 怎能蒙神向我显明？  浑噩如我，竟也蒙宠，  永恒之光照明！ 
4 主已开辟新活之路，  可达荣美住处； 
 祂作牺牲完成救赎，  圣灵能力向我倾注，  神前为我求祝。 
5 使我成圣，活在神前，  永为光明之子。 
 不必再受黑暗欺骗，  住在光中，直到永远，  都因神爱赏赐。 
535 ETERNAL LIGHT ETERNAL LIGHT
1 Eternal Light! Eternal Light! 
 How pure the soul must be 
 When, placed within Thy searching sight,  It shrinks not, but with calm delight 
 Can live and look on Thee. 
2 The spirits that surround Thy throne 
 May bear the burning bliss; 
 But that is surely theirs alone, 
 Since they have never, never known 
 A fallen world like this. 
3 Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere 
 Is dark, whose mind is dim, 
 Before th’Ineffable appear, 
 And on my natural spirit bear 
 The uncreated beam? 
4 There is a way for man to rise 
 To Thee, sublime Abode; 
 An Offering and a Sacrifice, 
 A Holy Spirit’s energies, 
 An Advocate with God: 
5 These, these prepare us for the sight 
 Of holiness above; 
 The sons of ignorance and night 
 May dwell in the eternal Light, 
 Through the eternal Love.
536 我的居所乃是神的自己
1 我的居所乃是神的自己，  我主基督将我带到这里；  祂带我走祂所走过的路，  到这至圣所里与神同住。  圣别所在！神圣荣美之家， 
 在此与神同住，至美绝佳！ 
2 夜以继日走过漫长的路，  自己里面想要找到一途；  一无所成，也无任何进步，  自我努力不过全是失误，  而后得知主是惟一道路，  我当藉祂、到神里面居住。 
3 奇妙住处，神圣荣美之家！  与神同住，安稳无以复加。  哦神，你我既是互为居所，  求你使我只是向你活着； 
 在这最美之家，得享安康，  随事随在，将你与人分享。 
536 MY HOME IS GOD HIMSELF CHRIST  BROUGHT ME THERE
1 My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,  And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;  He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,  Within the holiest at home with God. 
 O holy place! O home divinely fair! 
 And we, God’s little ones, abiding there. 
2 A long, long road I traveled night and day, 
 And sought to find within myself some way,  Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near; 
 Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,  And then I found Christ was the only way 
 That I must come to Him and in Him stay. 
3 O wondrous place! O home divinely fair! 
 And I, God’s little one, safe hidden there. 
 Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me, 
 So make me dead to everything but Thee; 
 That as I rest within my home most fair, 
 I’ll share my God in all and everywhere.
537 我心因神宁静平安
1 我心因神宁静平安，  因此向祂颂赞； 
 有一秘源在我心坎：  涌流各样美善。 
和 出人意外神的平安，  我要时刻颂赞；  有一秘源在我心坎：  涌流各样美善。 
2 我是被造脆弱器皿，  只可让你倾注； 
 世上名泉虽曾畅饮，  干渴仍未止住！ 
3 我们渴慕生命泉源，  如今终日涌流； 
 我所寻求爱的宝殿，  如今竟归我有。 
4 喜乐新歌今在我口，  我所久爱曲调； 
 此歌赞美恩典丰厚，  但我未尽尝到。 
5 我的产业令我喜乐，  虽我犹未尽历； 
 流血的手为我取得，  为我持守到底。 
6 我今有一爱的确信，  使我心能安息； 
 今日我心平静安稳，  你必供我所需。 
7 主赐一切归我所有，  我今向你求恳： 
 吸引我心归你所有，  使我与你同心。 
537 MY HEART IS RESTING O MY GOD
1 My heart is resting, O my God, 
 I will give thanks and sing; 
 My heart is at the secret source 
 Of every precious thing. 
(C) Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,  I daily, hourly sing; 
 My heart is at the secret source 
 Of every precious thing. 
2 Now this frail vessel Thou hast made, 
 No hand but Thine shall fill; 
 The waters of the earth have failed, 
 And I am thirsty still. 
3 I thirst for springs of heavenly life, 
 And here all day they rise; 
 I seek the treasure of Thy love, 
 And close at hand it lies. 
4 A glad, new song is in my mouth, 
 To long-loved music set, 
 A song of praise for all the grace 
 I have not tasted yet. 
5 I have a heritage of joy 
 That yet I must not see; 
 The hand that bled to make it mine 
 Is keeping it for me. 
6 There is a certainty of love 
 That sets my heart at rest; 
 A calm assurance for today 
 That to be poor is best. 
7 A prayer reposing on His truth, 
 Who hath made all things mine; 
 That draws my captive will to Him, 
 And makes it one with Thine.
523 祂带领我此意何美
1 祂带领我，此意何美！  此言充满天上安慰！  处处、事事、所是、所作，  都有主手来带领我。 
和 祂带领我，祂带领我，  祂是亲手在带领我；  任何境遇，我都随着，  因祂亲手在带领我。 
2 有时似堕痛苦深渊，  有时似在快乐伊甸；  或遇平顺，或遭风波，  都有主手来带领我。 
3 主阿，愿你紧握我手，  领我一生随你而走；  是福是苦由你定夺，  只要你手来带领我。 
4 等我行完今生路程，  靠你恩典完全得胜；  死河寒波我亦不躲，  因你至终亲手领我。 
523 HE LEADETH ME O BLESSED THOUGHT
1 He leadeth me! O blessed thought, 
 O words with heav’nly comfort fraught; 
 Whate’er I do, where’er I be, 
 Still ‘tis Christ’s hand that leadeth me. 
(C) He leadeth me! He leadeth me! 
 By His own hand He leadeth me; 
 His faithful follower I would be, 
 For by His hand He leadeth me. 
2 Sometimes ‘mid scenes of deepest gloom, 
 Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, 
 By waters still, o’er troubled sea, 
 Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me. 
3 Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, 
 Nor ever murmur or repine; 
 Content, whatever lot I see, 
 Since it is Thou that leadest me. 
4 And when my task on earth is done, 
 When, by Thy grace, the vict’ry’s won, 
 E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee, 
 Since Thou in triumph leadest me.
524 神在天上有一宝贝
1 神在天上有一宝贝，  丰富无人能言述； 
 永远心爱、无价宝贵，  就是祂子主基督。  神在地上有一宝贝，  价值惟有神知悉； 
 莫测大爱人难测窥 -   基督启示我心里。 
2 神藉火焰舌头临到，  用这永远无穷尽、  取用不竭的无价宝，  充满所选的器皿。  神从天上荣耀里头，  亲来充满这器皿， 
 用祂爱的无限富有，  满足所有渴慕心。 
3 虽受折磨、试炼、试探，  荣耀呼召仍属你； 
 葡萄树枝与树相联，  向主倒空你自己。  泥土器皿世人鄙视，  软弱、贫穷又卑贱，  装着宝贝神心赏识，  将主荣耀来彰显。 
4 愿我更加倒空、谦卑，  不为人知、不显扬，  作神器皿，更圣、更贵，  充满基督的荣光！ 
 无何地物遮此荣光，  也无自己的遮蔽， 
 将这奇妙故事宣扬，  倒空、充满祂自己。 
524 GOD IN HEAVEN HATH A TREASURE
1 God in heaven hath a treasure, 
 Riches none may count or tell; 
 Hath a deep eternal pleasure, 
 Christ the Son, He loveth well. 
 God hath here on earth a treasure, 
 None but He its price may know —  
 Deep, unfathomable pleasure, 
 Christ revealed in saints below. 
2 God in tongues of fire descending, 
 Chosen vessels thus to fill 
 With the treasure never ending, 
 Ever spent — unfailing still. 
 God’s own hand the vessel filling 
 From the glory far above, 
 Longing hearts forever stilling 
 With the riches of His love. 
3 Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,  Glorious calling, saint, is thine; 
 Let the Lord but find thee emptied, 
 Living branch in Christ the Vine! 
 Vessels of the world’s despising, 
 Vessels weak and poor and base, 
 Bearing wealth God’s heart is prizing, 
 Glory from Christ’s blessed face. 
4 Oh to be but emptier, lowlier, 
 Mean, unnoticed — and unknown, 
 And to God a vessel holier, 
 Filled with Christ and Christ alone! 
 Naught of earth to cloud the glory, 
 Naught of self the light to dim, 
 Telling forth His wondrous story, 
 Emptied to be filled with Him.
525 非我惟主被人高举并爱敬
1 非我惟主，被人高举并爱敬；  非我惟主，被人传扬、相信；  非我惟主，显在言语和步武；  非我惟主，显在思想、态度。 
和 哦，求主救我脱离自己！  失去在你里面！ 
 哦，但愿不再是自己，  惟主活我里面！ 
2 非我惟主，是我一切的起首；  非我惟主，是供给的源头；  非我惟主，是我所为而工作；  非我惟主，是我所为生活。 
3 主，惟有主，所以不再有闲言；  主，惟有主，所以不再自怜；  主，惟有主，所以不再为自己；  主，惟有主，所以不再自义。 
4 非我惟主，故无一可以自傲；  非我惟主，故无一可自暴；  非我惟主，因此不再有重担；  非我惟主，因此不怕危难。 
5 主，惟有主，不久充满我眼睛，  荣耀无比，不久就要显明；  主，惟有主，要永受我的感谢，  耶稣基督，要永是我一切。 
525 NOT I BUT CHRIST BE HONORED LOVED  EXALTED
11.10.11.10. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing the Lord 
1 Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted, 
 Not I, but Christ be seen, be known and heard; 
 Not I, but Christ in every look and action, 
 Not I, but Christ in every thought and word. 
(C) Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord, 
 Oh, to be lost in Thee, 
 Oh, that it may be no more I, 
 But Christ that lives in me. 
2 Not I, but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow, 
 Not I, but Christ to wipe the falling tear; 
 Not I, but Christ to lift the weary burden, 
 Not I, but Christ to hush away all fear. 
3 Christ, only Christ, no idle word e’er falling, 
 Christ, only Christ, no needless bustling sound; 
 Christ, only Christ, no self-important bearing, 
 Christ, only Christ, no trace of I be found. 
4 Not I, but Christ my every need supplying, 
 Not I, but Christ my strength and health to be; 
 Christ, only Christ, for spirit, soul, and body, 
 Christ, only Christ, live then Thy life in me. 
5 Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision, 
 Glory excelling soon, full soon I’ll see; 
 Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling, 
 Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.\ 
526 神照祂形像造人
1 神照祂形像造人，  好让祂充满； 
 人就成祂模成品，  这是祂心愿！ 
 是的，人有神样式，  形像也相称， 
 神的生命和所是，  祂都要模成！ 
2 亚当生命如树果，  含树的本质； 
 人受造将神得着 -   何等的价值！ 
 人确是神的容器，  祂如此设计， 
 神人美德真一律，  人与神合一 
3 但人堕落，形像毁；  容器成空虚。 
 基督救赎来挽回：  神旨不废去。 
 救主耶稣神而人 -   神形像何真： 
 神、人性质集一身，  来住你我身。 
4 人若常住祂里面，  祂就会加添； 
 生命美德渐充满，  透过人显现！ 
 那时，人有神样式，  形像也相称， 
 神的生命和所是，  祂都已模成。 
526 IN GOD’S IMAGE WE WERE MADE
1 In God’s image we were made; 
 Made for Him to fill, 
 Thus Himself to duplicate, and 
 Duplicate He will! 
 “In God’s image,” yes, indeed —  
 Matching ev’ry trait. 
 All His inner life and being 
 He will duplicate! 
2 Adam’s life was like a cone 
 To contain the Tree; 
 Man was made to take in God —  
 What capacity! 
 God’s container, yes, indeed! 
 Thus He did design 
 All the human virtues to be 
 Filled with the divine. 
3 Lost, the image, through man’s fall; 
 Lost, the life to fill. 
 But — recovered! — Christ is all: 
 God will do it still. 
 Christ our Savior — God and Man —  
 Is God’s image tree: 
 Human virtues, life divine 
 Dwell in me and you. 
4 As we spend more time with Him, 
 He will spread in us; 
 Virtues filled with life within: 
 Image glorious! 
 We will match Him — yes, indeed; 
 Match His every trait! 
 All His inner life and being 
 He will duplicate!
527 主我所盼望所切慕
1 主，我所盼望、所切慕，  乃是基督能显大； 
 无论生死，无论乐苦，  叫我持守不偏差。 
和 主，没有一事能叫我羞愧，  虽损失、艰苦并难为，  凡事仍叫基督照常显出，  生命借着十架流露。 
2 这事藉众圣徒祈祷， 
 并全备之灵帮助， 
 完全救恩终必达到！ 
 这见证何等丰足。 
3 主，你虚己，存心顺服，  竟死在十字架上； 
 被神升高，万膝拜服，  何等完美的榜样。 
4 何等有福，今这榜样，  已作到我的心里！ 
 卑微受死，高升天上，  如此奇恩真希奇。 
5 故当作成得救工夫， 
 因我们立志行事， 
 乃神运行心里之故， 
 为要成就祂美旨。 
6 我们就能无可指摘， 
 好像明光来照耀， 
 在这弯曲悖谬时刻， 
 表明出生命之道。 
7 要在主里行事为人， 
 与基督福音相称； 
 同心努力，同灵站稳，  成为耶稣的见证。 
527 LORD OUR EARNEST EXPECTATION
1 Lord, our earnest expectation 
 Is that Christ be magnified, 
 And in all our circumstances 
 Universally applied. 
(C) Lord, in nothing will we be ashamed, 
 Though in suffering, hardship, loss, 
 But in all things Christ shall be expressed,  Life shall triumph through the cross! 
2 This shall turn to our salvation, 
 Through the Spirit bountiful 
 And the prayers of all the members, 
 For a testimony full. 
3 Lord, we praise You for the pattern 
 Of a living crucified, 
 And the Father’s exaltation 
 Of Yourself so qualified. 
4 O how blest, this living pattern 
 Now is being wrought in ust 
 Crucifixion, exaltation —  
 Our salvation marvelous. 
5 We will work out our salvation 
 Through the operating God, 
 Through the willing and the working 
 Wrought within us by the Lord. 
6 Then we’ll blameless be and guileless, 
 Shining in the world as light, 
 In a crooked generation 
 Holding forth the word of life. 
7 Let us stand firm in one spirit, 
 Always striving with one soul, 
 That for Jesus’ testimony 
 God through us may reach His goal.
528 神照祂的形像造人
1 神照祂的形像造人，  叫人在地上代表神；  创造说出神的心意：  神要藉人彰显自己，  藉此祂叫万有周详：  神就是爱，神就是光；  公义法则、圣洁性情，  藉人发表，藉人显明。
2 因人堕落，人性受污；  神的器皿，破坏、玷污。  神差基督，作人救主；  人性美德，复原如初。  祂来作人，拔高人性；  更以神性，充实、坚定。  神被显出，充分无比；  并且又来，住人心里！ 
3 祂之所是，作我供应；  神的心愿，藉祂达成：  通过我们，复原人性，  祂的自己，得以显明。  神性丰盛，祂里积蓄；  祂这种子，我们所需；  祂被种在我们心里， 
 将祂美德分赐无遗。 
4 我们天天将祂瞻仰，  圣灵作工在我身上：  祂要更新内里各部，  模成祂形，完全无误。 
 故当抓住每一时机，  将祂人性尽情吸取；  好让圣灵更新变化，  直到我们完全像祂。 
528 WHEN GOD CREATED MAN ON EARTH
1 When God created man on earth, 
 He by His image gave 
 His treasure in creation see: 
 His image in humanity. 
 That God is love could then be known; 
 That He is light would then be 
 His holy nature, righteous ways 
 Would shine in men through all their days. 
2 The fall these human virtues soiled; 
 God’s vessel then seemed hopeless, spoiled.  But Christ, the God-Man-Savior came 
 These human virtues to reclaim. 
 He lived a human life so fine, 
 Strengthened and filled with life divine, 
 Expressing God in every part, 
 Then came to dwell within our heart!  
3 Now He is all that we require 
 That God may have His heart’s desire: 
 Himself expressed in mankind see 
 Through our restored humanity. 
 Yes, He is everything we need 
 The image-reproducing seed; 
 He’s now been sown into our heart, 
 His human virtues to impart. 
4 If we behold Him every day, 
 He’ll as the Spirit have His way: 
 Our inward parts He will transform, 
 And to His image us conform. 
 Take every opportunity 
 To drink of His humanity; 
 Transforming Spirit to bring in 
 Until we shine, expressing Him.
529 每当我们享受恩主
1 每当我们享受恩主， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 每一杯都注满溢出， 
 丰富供应我所需。 
 既不狭窄，也无不够， 
 流自祂丰富宝库； 
 祂赐我们十足升斗，上尖下流不停住。  祂赐我们十足升斗，上尖下流不停住。 
2 每当我们从父领受， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 心存感谢，享受所有， 
 赞美祂顾我所需。 
 满足、全备、深厚、丰富， 
 我所需祂都供应， 
 每当我心尝到耶稣， 总是满足我衷情。  每当我心尝到耶稣，总是满足我衷情。 
3 每当我们分享主爱， 
 总是充足而有余； 
 阔、长、深、高，无法明白， 
 远超过我们所需。 
 我们嘴唇无法述尽， 祂所有奇妙柔爱；  我们只有希奇、感恩，赞美祂名到万代。  我们只有希奇、感恩， 
 赞美祂名到万代。 
529 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING OVER
1 There is always something over, 
 When we taste our gracious Lord; 
 Every cup He fills o’erfloweth, 
 Rich supply He doth afford. 
 Nothing narrow, nothing stinted, 
 Ever issued from His store; 
 To His own He gives full measure, 
 Running over, evermore. 
2 There is always something over, 
 When we, from the Father’s hand, 
 Take our portion with thanksgiving, 
 Praising for the things He planned. 
 Satisfaction, full and deepening, 
 All our need He doth supply, 
 When the heart has tasted Jesus 
 Its desires to satisfy. 
3 There is always something over, 
 When we share in all His love; 
 Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us, 
 Unscaled heights rise far above. 
 Human lips can never utter 
 All His wondrous tenderness. 
 We can only praise and wonder 
 And His Name forever bless. 

530 主耶稣乃是实际

 众先知所仰望的，  义人所渴求、经营，  你都能予求予取 -   求祂名。

530 JESUS IS REALITY
1 Jesus is reality, 
 He is life for you and me 
 And our ev’rything would be.  Call Him Lord. 
 What the prophets waited for  And the righteous had in store  You may have forevermore 
 Call Him Lord. 
(C) Call Him Lord. Call Him Lord.  In the spirit, by the Spirit, 
 Call Him Lord. 
 He has called you for His own,  In your heart His Word is sown,  You can make your heart His throne.  Call Him Lord. 
2 All the world would you forsake,  All sin’s bondage fully break,  Fully of His life partake? 
 Eat His Word. 
 God desires to be your life, 
 Set you free from every strife.  Come and taste the Tree of Life.  Eat His Word. 
(C) Eat His Word, Eat His Word,  Get it early, get it hourly, 
 Eat His Word. 
 What a treasure in your hand!  What an all-inclusive Land!  For your up-to-date demand,  Eat His Word. 
3 With our old life now we’re done,  For the Day is coming on 
 And the night is almost gone:  Overcome! 
 Praise the Lord we have an ear,   In the church life we can hear  Jesus calling very clear: 
 Overcome! 
(C) Overcome! Overcome! 
 By obeying what He’s saying,  Overcome! 
 All our oldness cast away 
 Through the Body-life today.  He will soon be here to stay:  Overcome!

531 从黑暗死亡和苦闷的深渊
1 从黑暗、死亡和苦闷的深渊，  主将我提升到祂宝座前；  不再受撒但权势奴役、欺骗，  与主一同超越，在祂身边。 
2 涌出有福释放，成就有余。
3 从惧怕、受压和失望的深谷，  兴起喜乐，受恩典的鼓舞；  与基督同作王，豫尝祂满足；  与祂同席，新郎荣脸得睹。 
531 OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS  DEATH AND ANGUISH
1 Out of the depths of darkness, death, and anguish,  Christ lifted me and brought me to His throne.  No more enslaved by Satan’s dark delusions,  With Christ transcendent, I am His alone. 
2 Out of the depths of weakness and frustration,  Set on the mount of praise and perfect peace;  Resting in Him, I know the sweet fulfillment  Of life within that flows in blest release. 
3 Out of the depths of fear and disappointment,  Set on the mount of splendor, joy, and grace;  Reigning with Christ, I taste His satisfaction;  Feasting with Him, I glimpse the Bridegroom’s face.
532 基督是恩典从那源头 - 天父而来

534 我神我爱我的永分
1 我神、我爱、我的永分， 
 你永是我一切； 
 你外，在天我有何人， 
 在地有你无缺！在地有你无缺！ 
2 天上一切尽都空虚， 
 地上更是如此！ 
 并无一物值得欢娱， 
 能与我神相似， 
 能与我神相似。 
3 你是我的财富、生命， 
 我的安稳住处； 
 其他事物，我虽感领， 
 但非我神、我主，但非我神、我主。 
4 闪耀财富，与你相比， 
 不过虚空玩具！ 
 何况其他人之所倚， 
 岂不更将人愚？ 岂不更将人愚？ 
5 即使全地归我为业， 
 群星也是我的， 
 若无你作我的一切， 
 我仍可怜至极！我仍可怜至极！ 
6 让人伸臂如同大海， 
 笼罗一切财富； 
 但我只要你的同在， 
 此外无所爱慕，此外无所爱慕。 
534 MY GOD MY PORTION AND MY LOVE
1 My God, my Portion, and my Love, 
 My everlasting All, 
 I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above, 
 Or on this earthly ball, Or on this earthly ball. 
2 What empty things are all the skies, 
 And this inferior clod! 
 There’s nothing here deserves my joys, 
 There’s nothing like my God, 
 There’s nothing like my God. 
3 To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends, 
 And health, and safe abode; 
 Thanks to Thy name for meaner things, 
 But they are not my God, But they are not my God. 
4 How vain a toy is glittering wealth, 
 If once compared to’ Thee! 
 Or what’s my safety, or my health, 
 Or all my friends to me, Or all my friends to me. 
5 Were I possessor of the earth, 
 And called the stars my own, 
 Without Thy graces and Thyself, 
 I were a wretch undone, I were a wretch undone. 
6 Let others stretch their arms like seas, 
 And grasp in all the shore; 
 Grant me the visits of Thy grace, 
 And I desire no more, And I desire no more.
535 永恒之光永恒之光
1 是灵、爱和光
1 永恒之光！永恒之光！  光照、鉴察我里， 
 将我净化，使我明亮；  面对这光，我心安详，  因我得以见你。 
2 围绕宝座天上众灵，  虽可同沐光明， 
 但是他们仅仅享用；  堕落世界痛苦光景，  他们绝不知情。 
3 像我生性愚昧昏蒙，  又居黑暗之中， 
 怎能蒙神向我显明？  浑噩如我，竟也蒙宠，  永恒之光照明！ 
4 主已开辟新活之路，  可达荣美住处； 
 祂作牺牲完成救赎，  圣灵能力向我倾注，  神前为我求祝。 
5 使我成圣，活在神前，  永为光明之子。 
 不必再受黑暗欺骗，  住在光中，直到永远，  都因神爱赏赐。 
535 ETERNAL LIGHT ETERNAL LIGHT
1 Eternal Light! Eternal Light! 
 How pure the soul must be 
 When, placed within Thy searching sight,  It shrinks not, but with calm delight 
 Can live and look on Thee. 
2 The spirits that surround Thy throne 
 May bear the burning bliss; 
 But that is surely theirs alone, 
 Since they have never, never known 
 A fallen world like this. 
3 Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere 
 Is dark, whose mind is dim, 
 Before th’Ineffable appear, 
 And on my natural spirit bear 
 The uncreated beam? 
4 There is a way for man to rise 
 To Thee, sublime Abode; 
 An Offering and a Sacrifice, 
 A Holy Spirit’s energies, 
 An Advocate with God: 
5 These, these prepare us for the sight 
 Of holiness above; 
 The sons of ignorance and night 
 May dwell in the eternal Light, 
 Through the eternal Love.
536 我的居所乃是神的自己
1 我的居所乃是神的自己，  我主基督将我带到这里；  祂带我走祂所走过的路，  到这至圣所里与神同住。  圣别所在！神圣荣美之家， 
 在此与神同住，至美绝佳！ 
2 夜以继日走过漫长的路，  自己里面想要找到一途；  一无所成，也无任何进步，  自我努力不过全是失误，  而后得知主是惟一道路，  我当藉祂、到神里面居住。 
3 奇妙住处，神圣荣美之家！  与神同住，安稳无以复加。  哦神，你我既是互为居所，  求你使我只是向你活着； 
 在这最美之家，得享安康，  随事随在，将你与人分享。 
536 MY HOME IS GOD HIMSELF CHRIST  BROUGHT ME THERE
1 My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,  And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;  He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,  Within the holiest at home with God. 
 O holy place! O home divinely fair! 
 And we, God’s little ones, abiding there. 
2 A long, long road I traveled night and day, 
 And sought to find within myself some way,  Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near; 
 Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,  And then I found Christ was the only way 
 That I must come to Him and in Him stay. 
3 O wondrous place! O home divinely fair! 
 And I, God’s little one, safe hidden there. 
 Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me, 
 So make me dead to everything but Thee; 
 That as I rest within my home most fair, 
 I’ll share my God in all and everywhere.
537 我心因神宁静平安
1 我心因神宁静平安，  因此向祂颂赞； 
 有一秘源在我心坎：  涌流各样美善。 
和 出人意外神的平安，  我要时刻颂赞；  有一秘源在我心坎：  涌流各样美善。 
2 我是被造脆弱器皿，  只可让你倾注； 
 世上名泉虽曾畅饮，  干渴仍未止住！ 
3 我们渴慕生命泉源，  如今终日涌流； 
 我所寻求爱的宝殿，  如今竟归我有。 
4 喜乐新歌今在我口，  我所久爱曲调； 
 此歌赞美恩典丰厚，  但我未尽尝到。 
5 我的产业令我喜乐，  虽我犹未尽历； 
 流血的手为我取得，  为我持守到底。 
6 我今有一爱的确信，  使我心能安息； 
 今日我心平静安稳，  你必供我所需。 
7 主赐一切归我所有，  我今向你求恳： 
 吸引我心归你所有，  使我与你同心。 
537 MY HEART IS RESTING O MY GOD
1 My heart is resting, O my God, 
 I will give thanks and sing; 
 My heart is at the secret source 
 Of every precious thing. 
(C) Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,  I daily, hourly sing; 
 My heart is at the secret source 
 Of every precious thing. 
2 Now this frail vessel Thou hast made, 
 No hand but Thine shall fill; 
 The waters of the earth have failed, 
 And I am thirsty still. 
3 I thirst for springs of heavenly life, 
 And here all day they rise; 
 I seek the treasure of Thy love, 
 And close at hand it lies. 
4 A glad, new song is in my mouth, 
 To long-loved music set, 
 A song of praise for all the grace 
 I have not tasted yet. 
5 I have a heritage of joy 
 That yet I must not see; 
 The hand that bled to make it mine 
 Is keeping it for me. 
6 There is a certainty of love 
 That sets my heart at rest; 
 A calm assurance for today 
 That to be poor is best. 
7 A prayer reposing on His truth, 
 Who hath made all things mine; 
 That draws my captive will to Him, 
 And makes it one with Thine.
538 你这神的甜美旨意
1 你这神的甜美旨意，  是我磐石，是我山寨，  是我灵的宁静居所，  我要藏身、安息你怀。 
2 惟神旨意，尽都美善，  你的引导都是最好；  我如孩童只知跟从，  依你胸怀，把你信靠。 
3 神的旨意，使苦变甜，  当它成就，何等美好；  若无神旨将其圣别，  一切欢乐尽都无聊。 
4 我神，你的甜美旨意，  紧抱我的被掳心意，  使它如一快乐小鸟，  被囚在你恩典领域。 
5 在这美善恩典之境，  你爱仍然伸展双翼，  或因你的完美拣选  所给恩泽满意安栖。 
6 最轻之担，最甜之轭，  将我乐魂提携、背负，  使我疲魂插翅上腾，  我的自由是你约束。 
7 我今躺卧于神旨意，  如同小孩安息母怀；  地上没有一个床榻，  令我如此安息、舒泰。 
8 我神，你的奇妙美旨，  今已得胜，成我心志；  对你每一爱的命令，  信心欢乐，答应说”是”。 
538 THOU SWEET BELOVED WILL OF GOD
1 Thou sweet, beloved will of God, 
 My anchor ground, my fortress hill, 
 My spirit’s silent, fair abode, 
 In Thee I hide me and am still. 
2 O Will, that willest good alone, 
 Lead Thou the way, Thou guidest best; 
 A little child, I follow on, 
 And, trusting, lean upon Thy breast. 
3 God’s will doth make the bitter sweet, 
 And all is well when it is done; 
 Unless His will doth hallow it, 
 The glory of all joy is gone. 
4 Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,  
 Holds fast in its sublime embrace 
 My captive will, a gladsome bird, 
 Prisoned in such a realm of grace. 
5 Within this place of certain good 
 Love evermore expands her wings, 
 Or nestling in Thy perfect choice, 
 Abides content with what it brings.  
6 Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke; 
 It lifts, it bears my happy soul, 
 It giveth wings to this poor heart; 
 My freedom is Thy grand control. 
7 Upon God’s will I lay me down, 
 As child upon its mother’s breast; 
 No silken couch, nor softest bed, 
 Could ever give me such deep rest. 
8 Thy wonderful grand will, my God, 
 With triumph now I make it mine; 
 And faith shall cry a joyous Yes 
 To every dear command of Thine.
539 从我灵里有一生命泉在涌流 -
1 三一神在我里畅流；
 父神是它源头，子神基督成就，  圣灵运行无往不透。 
和 主，我宝爱这生命水流，  我将魂生命放你脚前； 
 主，求你扩大这条纯流，  你来时，生命作我冠冕。 
2 主耶稣使我躺在那嫩草地场；  又领我到宁静水边； 
 在这生命流中，祝福何等深广，  因此不再挣扎枉然。 
3 有一天，主呼召我到祂至圣所，  活在祂同在的身边； 
 阿利路亚，我听到鼓励的话说：  “枝子要常住树里面。”  
539 FROM MY SPIRIT WITHIN FLOWS A  FOUNTAIN OF LIFE
12.8.12.8. WITH CHORUS 
Experiencing God 
1 The Triune God flowing in me;
 God the Father’s the source, Christ the Son is the course,  And the Spirit imparts life to me. 
(C) Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life, 
 And my soul-life at last I lay down; 
 O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life; 
 At Your coming may life be my crown. 
2 In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;  He leads me by waters of rest; 
 No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;  In the flow I am perfectly blessed. 
3 Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,  To live in His presence divine; 
 Hallelujah, I’ve heard an encouraging word:  “Abide — you’re a branch in the vine.”
540 神你自古是我帮助
1 神，你自古是我帮助，  又是将来盼望； 
 你是风雨中避难处，  又是永远家乡。 
2 在你宝座荫庇之下，  圣徒居住安稳； 
 因你膀臂能力极大，  周围保护我们。 
3 山岭根基未曾奠定，  天地尚未构成； 
 亘古太初你就是神，  历永世不变更。 
4 千年在你好似一日，  逝有如过一夕； 
 又像夜来五更一尽，  又见旭日东升。 
5 时间犹如长流河川，  把那众生冲去； 
 往而不返如梦如幻，  醒来全部忘记。 
6 神，你自古是我帮助，  又是将来盼望； 
 愿你将我终生保护，  为我永远家乡。 
540 O GOD OUR HELP IN AGES PAST
1 O God, our help in ages past, 
 Our hope for years to come, 
 Our shelter from the stormy blast, 
 And our eternal home. 
2 Under the shadow of Thy throne 
 Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
 Sufficient is Thine arm alone, 
 And our defence is sure. 
3 Before the hills in order stood, 
 Or earth received her frame, 
 From everlasting Thou art God, 
 To endless years the same. 
4 A thousand ages in Thy sight 
 Are like an evening gone; 
 Short as the watch that ends the night 
 Before the rising sun. 
5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
 Bears all its sons away; 
 They fly forgotten, as a dream 
 Dies at the opening day. 
6 O God, our help in ages past, 
 Our hope for years to come, 
 Be Thou our guard while life shall last,  And our eternal home.

542 THE CROSS WE ALL WERE THERE IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
1 we all were there,

 Hallelujah! hallelujah! 
 God there upon it died, 
 And man and all beside 
 Were wholly crucified —  
 Hallelujah for the cross!

543 在远山耸立着古老的十字架
1 在远山耸立着古老的十字架，  作为羞辱、痛苦标志；
 我爱这十字架，因主离荣耀家，  来在其上替人受死。 
和 我宝贵古老的十字架，  一直到我俯伏主脚前；  我坚持古老的十字架，  等有天，我将它换冠冕。 
2 古老的十字架，不少人很轻视，  对我却有奇妙吸力； 
 神圣洁的羔羊曾降临到此世，  将它背至髑髅死地。 
3 古老的十字架，染斑斑的血迹，  从我眼光何等可悦！ 
 就在这十字架，主受苦到至极，  为要赐我赦免、圣洁。 
4 我永远要效忠古老的十字架，  欢喜受它所受讥诮； 
 有一天主要来召我回到天家，  永远享受祂的荣耀。 
543 ON A HILL FAR AWAY STOOD AN OLD  RUGGED CROSS
12.8.12.8. WITH CHORUS 
The Way ofthe Cross 
1 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, 
 The emblem of suffering and shame, 
 And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best  For a world of lost sinners was slain. 
(C) So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
 I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
 And exchange it some day for a crown 
2 Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,  Has a wondrous attraction for me; 
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,  To bear it to dark Calvary. 
3 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,  A wondrous beauty I see; 
 For ‘twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,  To pardon and sanctify me. 
4 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, 
 It’s shame and reproach gladly bear; 
 Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,  Where His glory forever I’ll share.
544 主十字架是我夸耀
1 主十字架是我夸耀， 
 年代灭没它独存； 
 神圣事迹光辉环绕， 
 十架巍然是中心。 
2 当我遭遇患难折磨， 
 希望成空，忧惧缠； 
 主十字架永不弃我， 
 看哪！喜乐与平安。 
3 有福太阳，以光以爱 
 照耀在我道路上； 
 主十字架放射光彩， 
 使我人生更光亮。 
4 是祸是福，是苦是乐， 
 十字架全使成圣； 
 在此平安深广莫测， 
 喜乐永远不变更。 
544 IN THE CROSS OF CHRIST I GLORY
1 In the cross of Christ I glory, 
 Tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time; 
 All the light of sacred story 
 Gathers round its head sublime. 
2 When the woes of life o’ertake me, 
 Hopes deceive, and fears annoy, 
 Never shall the cross forsake me, 
 Lo! It glows with peace and joy. 
3 When the sun of bliss is beaming 
 Light and love upon my way, 
 From the cross the radiance streaming 
 Adds more luster to the day. 
4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, 
 By the cross are sanctified; 
 Peace is there that knows no measure, 
 Joys that through all time abide.
545 我与基督已同钉死
1 我与基督已同钉死，
 十架已将我解释； 
 我与基督已同复活， 
 祂活我里，管理我。 
和 与基督同死，何等的甘甜！  脱世界、自己、罪愆！  与基督同活，何等的甘甜！  祂活我里并掌权。 
2 历世历代所藏奥秘， 
 今藉信心可知悉： 
 荣耀盼望 - 基督居衷，  应当无时不歌颂。 
3 天然景物都有隐征： 
 麦种死了子粒生； 
 珍木接在贱树上面， 
 小则换大，苦换甜。 
4 这个就是圣洁秘诀 -  
 不是自己无残缺； 
 主阿，求你虚我、满我，  扩我度量给我多。 
5 这个会使病痛得治 -  
 只要你向自己死， 
 并以主的生命能力 
 作为全人的供给。 
6 经过十架，达到宝座，  主是这样的领率， 
 先是死亡，后是荣耀，  主既如此我仿效。 
545 I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
1 I am crucified with Christ, 
 And the cross hath set me free; 
 I have ris’n again with Christ, 
 And He lives and reigns in me. 
(C) Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ,  To the world, and self, and sin; 
 Oh! it is so sweet to live with Christ,  As He lives and reigns within.  
2 Mystery hid from ancient ages! 
 But at length to faith made plain: 
 Christ in me the Hope of Glory, 
 Tell it o’er and o’er again. 
3 This the secret nature hideth, 
 Harvest grows from buried grain; 
 A poor tree with better grafted, 
 Richer, sweeter life doth gain. 
4 This the secret of the holy, 
 Not our holiness, but Him; 
 O Lord! empty us and fill us, 
 With Thy fulness to the brim. 
5 This the balm for pain and sickness, 
 Just to all our strength to die, 
 And to find His life and fulness, 
 All our being’s need supply. 
6 This the story of the Master, 
 Thru the Cross, He reached the Throne,  And like Him our path to glory, 
 Ever leads through death alone.
546 我与基督已同钉死
1 我与基督已同钉死，
 脱自己、罪恶、俗世；  所以我能平安接领 
 主从死而生的命。 
 我今甘愿同祂受苦， 
 效法祂至死顺服； 
 我愿跟主耶稣基督 
 一直走十架窄路。 
和 一直走十架窄路！ 
 主是受死在那里！ 
 求主使我能同你 
 一直走十架窄路！ 
2 我何难与基督同死， 
 因复活我已认识； 
 我何难与耶稣同苦， 
 因神旨我愿顺服。 
 主已借着复活能力， 
 今重生在我灵里， 
 因此我今欢乐迈步， 
 一直走十架窄路。 
3 与同主死，就必同生，  同受苦，必同高升； 
 惟得胜者都照这样， 
 才能蒙基督奖赏。 
 真可乐！若在那早晨，  你听主对你发声， 
 以为你曾忠心顺服， 
 一直走十架窄路！ 
546 CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST MY SAVIOR
1 Crucified with Christ my Savior, 
 To the world and self and sin; 
 To the death-born life of Jesus 
 I am sweetly ent’ring in: 
 In His fellowship of suff’ring, 
 To His death conformed to be, 
 I am going with my Savior 
 All the way to Calvary. 
(C) All the way to Calvary, 
 Where my Savior went for me, 
 Help me, Lord, to go with Thee, 
 All the way to Calvary. 
2 ‘Tis not hard to die with Christ 
 When His risen life we know; 
 ‘Tis not hard to share His suff’rings 
 When our hearts with joy o’erflow. 
 In His resurrection power 
 He has come to dwell in me, 
 And my heart is gladly going 
 All the way to Calvary. 
3 If we die we’ll live with Christ,  
 If we suffer we shall reign; 
 Only thus the prize of glory 
 Can the conqueror attain. 
 Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning 
 Should the Master say to thee, 
 “Yes, my child, thou didst go with me 
 All the way to Calvary.”
547 基督虽能千趟
1 基督虽能千趟
 降生于伯利恒， 
 若未活你心坎， 
 救恩仍是无成。 
 各各他的十架， 
 还不会拯救你； 
 在你里的十架， 
 才有能医治你。 
和 哦！基督的十字架，  我接你进我心， 
 使我脱自己管辖， 
 完全靠神的生命。 
2 人哪！你爱何物， 
 就要像你所慕： 
 如主，你若爱主； 
 如土，你若爱土； 
 出己，神就进入； 
 死己，神就活出； 
 无你，就有基督； 
 无物，就得万物。 
3 你若要得着神， 
 “爱”是最短路程； 
 你若跟从智慧， 
 就难免常纡回。 
 你若不为自己 
 寻求什么利益， 
 神的荣耀自己， 
 就要充满了你。 
547 THOUGH CHRIST A THOUSAND TIMES
1 Though Christ a thousand times 
 In Bethlehem be born, 
 If He’s not born in thee 
 Thy soul is still forlorn. 
 The Cross on Golgotha, 
 Will never save thy soul; 
 The Cross in thine own heart, 
 Alone can make thee whole. 
(C) O, Cross of Christ, I take thee 
 Into this heart of mine, 
 That I to my own self may die 
 And rise to thy life Divine. 
2 What e’er thou lovest, man, 
 That too become thou must; 
 God, if thou lovest God, 
 Dust, if thou lovest dust. 
 Go out, God will come in; 
 Die thou and let Him live; 
 Be not and He will be; 
 Wait and He’ll all things give. 
3 To bring thee to thy God, 
 Love takes the shortest route; 
 The way which knowledge leads, 
 Is but a roundabout. 
 Drive out from thee the world, 
 And then thy heart shall be 
 Filled with the love of God, 
 And holy like as He.
548 后是膏油先是宝血
1 后是膏油，先是宝血，
 要得滋润先得洁； 
 若不是经过各各他， 
 必不能到五旬节。 
 我们若还未蒙洗净， 
 能力必不从上倾； 
 我们若是要作见证， 
 必须钉死己生命。 
和 故求主藉十字架， 
 治死我的魂生命； 
 使我愿出大代价， 
 来满受主的圣灵。 
2 先是用杖击打石盘， 
 后来活水才溢漫； 
 死亡若是未作过工， 
 圣灵必定不充满。 
 我们若真同主受死， 
 愿意万有都损失， 
 主的能力就要降临， 
 使用我们救亡世。 
3 先是祭坛后才是火， 
 若没丧失就没果； 
 若不先将所有奉献， 
 必定不能登宝座。 
 我们若是真肯牺牲， 
 舍弃万事降服神， 
 我们必定得着能力， 
 因主信托顺从人。 
4 先是豫备瓶子都空， 
 后是膏油盛其中； 
 先是山谷挖成渠沟， 
 后是活水才深泓； 
 我们先经过约但河， 
 后才灵感加倍多； 
 先肯接受死亡浸洗， 
 后得荣耀的圣鸽。 
5 当你举目观望禾田， 
 金榖丰盈你称羡； 
 当思果实尚未生时， 
 就有麦种死在先。 
 若想要得生命子粒， 
 须有死亡的经历； 
 凡是人未到髑髅地， 
 就无圣灵的能力。 
6 既是这样，故求我主， 
 使我忠诚走窄路， 
 除去我的雄心大志， 
 只愿顺服并受苦； 
 更大能力我不求取， 
 更深的死我所需； 
 但愿十架所有意义， 
 完全成功在我躯。 
548 FIRST THE BLOOD AND THEN THE  OINTMENT
8.7.8.7.D. WITH CHORUS 
The Way ofthe Cross 
1 First the blood, and then the ointment, 
 Cleansing, then anointing comes; 
 If we pass not thru Golgotha, 
 Ne’er to Pentecost we’ll come. 
 If the blood has never cleansed us, 
 Ne’er the Spirit’s pow’r we’ll know, 
 If for Christ we’d truly witness, 
 Self-life to the Cross must go. 
(C) Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray, 
 Put my soul-life all away; 
 Make me any price to pay, 
 Full anointing to receive. 
2 Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten, 
 That the living water flow; 
 Without death the Spirit’s fulness 
 Ne’er could dwell in man below. 
 If with Christ we die completely, 
 Willing thus our all to lose, 
 He will clothe us with His power 
 And to win the world will use. 
3 First the altar, then the fire, 
 If no loss, there’ll be no gain; 
 If our all has not been offered, 
 To the throne we’ll ne’er attain. 
 If to sacrifice we’re willing, 
 All forsaking, God t’obey, 
 He to us will be committed 
 And thru us His pow’r display. 
4 First we must prepare the vessels 
 That the Oil they may contain; 
 Dig the valley full of ditches 
 That they may be filled with Rain. 
 First we must go thru the Jordan 
 Ere anointed from above; 
 First in death we must be baptized, 
 Then experience the Dove. 
5 When we see the ripened harvest 
 Of the golden countryside, 
 We may know that many seeds have 
 Fallen to the earth and died. 
 Ere the fruit of life may blossom, 
 We must surely suffer death; 
 If with Christ we’ve not been buried, 
 We’ll not feel the Spirit’s breath. 
6 Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord, 
 Help me go the narrow way; 
 Deal with pride and make me willing 
 Thus to suffer, Thee t’obey. 
 I for greater power pray not. 
 Deeper death is what I need; 
 All the meaning of the Cross, Lord, 
 Work in my — for this I plead.
549 十字架的道路要牺牲
1 特.和.
十字架的道路──生命之路 
1 十字架的道路要牺牲， 
 要将一切献于神， 
 将一切放在死的祭坛上面，  火才在这里显现。 
和 这是十架道路！你愿否走这个？  你曾否背十架为你主？ 
 你这奉献一切给神的人！  对神你是否全贞？ 
2 当我们唱诗祷告时候， 
 何等愿说”献所有！”  
 但前面有更沉重的十字架！  有更艰难的生涯！ 
3 你要变节；或忠心到死，  让你一切都损失， 
 直等到永活主的丰盛生命，  天天充满在你灵？ 
4 神的救法是由死得生 -  
 你与主合为一人 -  
 在十架，你因信已与祂同钉，  从你身活出祂命。 
549 THE WAY OF THE CROSS MEANS  SACRIFICE
1 IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
The Way ofthe Cross 
1 The way of the Cross means sacrifice, 
 As to God you yield your all 
 To be laid on the altar, the place of death,  Where fire will surely fall. 
(C) ‘Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?  What does bearing the Cross mean to you?  You who’ve given yourself, your all to God!  To God are you wholly true? 
2 As the voice of song and prayer we raise,  How easy to say, We give all; 
 Till some rougher cross lies just before,  And sterner is duty’s call. 
3 Do you falter then, or, true to death, 
 Just die on the cross in the way, 
 Till the fulness of life from the Living One  Is filling you day by day? 
4 ‘Tis the plan of life, for you die to live, 
 One with Jesus crucified; 
 With the life alone to be lived through you,  Of the Risen, the Glorified.

550 如果我的道路
1 如果我的道路
 引我去受苦， 
 如果你是命定 
 要我历艰辛， 
 就愿你我从兹 
 交通益亲挚， 
 时也刻也无间， 
 弥久弥香甜。 
2 如果地乐消减， 
 求你多给天； 
 虽然心可伤痛， 
 愿灵仍赞颂； 
 地的香甜联结， 
 若因你分裂， 
 就愿你我之间， 
 联结更香甜。 
3 这路虽然孤单， 
 求你作我伴， 
 用你笑容鼓舞 
 我来尽前途； 
 主，我靠你恩力， 
 望能无自己， 
 作一洁净器皿， 
 流出你生命。 
550 IF THE PATH I TRAVEL
1 If the path I travel 
 Lead me to the cross, 
 If the way Thou choosest 
 Lead to pain and loss, 
 Let the compensation 
 Daily, hourly, be 
 Shadowless communion, 
 Blessed Lord, with Thee. 
2 If there’s less of earth joy, 
 Give, Lord, more of heaven.  Let the spirit praise Thee, 
 Though the heart be riven; 
 If sweet earthly ties, Lord, 
 Break at Thy decree, 
 Let the tie that binds us, 
 Closer, sweeter, be. 
3 Lonely though the pathway,  Cheer it With Thy smile; 
 Be Thou my companion 
 Through earth’s little while;  Selfless may I live, Lord, 
 By Thy grace to be 
 Just a cleansed channel 
 For Thy life through me.
551 从伯利恒我们动身
1 从伯利恒我们动身，
 学习耶稣的忠贞， 
 跟着祂要完全归神， 
 纵然脸上满泪痕； 
 因为马槽那样寒陋， 
 并非我们所爱视； 
 但是脚须与祂同走， 
 如果手要接赏赐。 
2 经拿撒勒，这条道路，  我们越走越窄小， 
 多年劳碌无人领悟， 
 常受羞辱，常无聊。 
 但神藉此教训我们： 
 如此苦难非无谓， 
 仆人不能大于主人， 
 故当与祂同流泪。 
3 经加利利，我们见祂 
 被人厌弃、被人诅； 
 祂路岂非走错了吗？ 
 不然那有许多苦？ 
 不！不！这段虽然崎岖，  祂仍前进平安过； 
 我们若要同祂高举， 
 也得前进不畏祸。 
4 随后就在客西马尼， 
 园中孤单受磨炼， 
 撒但全军都来攻逼， 
 这样光景真难遣！ 
 但是我们并不失败， 
 因有天使来服事， 
 并说：”应当注目赏赉，  争战不过此一时。”  
5 十架到了！因为所有 
 忠魂都当经加略； 
 我们在此同祂蒙羞， 
 不肯自怜，不退却； 
 因为不过一点时候， 
 我们如此感苦痛； 
 将来见祂，一切忧愁，  消失在祂笑容中。 
6 随到坟墓，亲友环泣，  知道已经无希望； 
 (亲爱旅伴！世人对你，  是否算为已经亡？)  
 我们从此与祂同升， 
远离属地的追求， 
 心里欢然失去世人 
 所谓生命和富有。 
7 我们努力向竿而前， 
 日近一日仍追随； 
 我们已经仿佛能见 
 天城四射的光辉； 
 我们已经隐约可闻 
 天乐悠扬的清音； 
 耶稣在彼迎接我们， 
 要慰百创的这心。 
8 不过，再过几里，朋友！  腿要不酸，身不累， 
不再有罪、不再有忧， 
 主要擦干你眼泪； 
 听祂正用柔声说道： 
 “勿恐，勿馁，仍力前，  因为也许明朝未到， 
 旅程就己到终点。”  
551 VIA BETHLEHEM WE JOURNEY
1 Via Bethlehem we journey, 
 We whose hearts on God are set; 
 Babelike souls of Jesus learning, 
 While our cheeks with tears are wet;  For the manger and the stable 
 Are not pleasant to our eyes, 
 But our feet must follow Jesus, 
 If our hands would grasp the prize. 
2 Via Nazareth! the pathway 
 Narrows still as on we go, 
 Years of toil none understanding, 
 Yet God teaches us to know 
 That the servant is not greater 
 Than the Lord, who thro’ long years  Hid Himself from this world’s glory,  Follow Him! Count not the tears. 
3 Via Galilee, we see Him! 
 Stones are hurled, and curses hissed 
 By the men who gather round Him, 
 Has He not the pathway missed? 
 No! unharmed the Savior passes, 
 And this rough bit of the way 
 We must travel, since like Jesus, 
 Nothing can our purpose stay. 
4 Via too, the awful anguish 
 Of the hours beneath the trees, 
 Where the hosts of Satan linger, 
 Awful hours of anguish these! 
 Yet we fail not, for God’s angels 
 Minister to us, and say, 
 “Look, beloved, at the glory, 
 Conflict is but for a day!” 
5 Then the Cross! for via Calvary 
 Every royal soul must go; 
 Here we draw the veil, for Jesus 
 Only can the pathway show; 
 “If we suffer with Him,” listen, 
 Just a little, little While, 
 And the memory will have faded 
 In the glory of His smile! 
6 Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,  Knowing that all life has fled; 
 (Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered  With the men the world calls dead?)  Thence we rise, and live with Jesus, 
 Throned above the world’s mad strife,  Gladly forfeiting forever, 
 All that worldlings count as life. 
7 On we press! and yonder gleaming, 
 Nearing every day, we see 
 The great walls of that fair city, 
 God has built for such as we; 
 And we catch the tender music 
 Of the choirs that sing of One 
 Who once died to have us with Him 
 In His kingdom, on the throne. 
8 Just a few more miles, beloved! 
 And our feet shall ache no more; 
 No more sin, and no more sorrow, 
 Hush thee, Jesus went before; 
 And I hear Him sweetly whispering,  “Faint not, fear not, still press on, 
 For it may be ere tomorrow, 
 The long journey will be done.”
552 你怎无伤痕
1 你怎无伤痕？ 
 无伤痕在你身上肋旁？  你名声反远播四方， 
 他们反赞美你的光芒？  你怎无伤痕？ 
2 你怎无伤痕？ 
 我受迫、孤独、挂在树上，  四围无情，残忍、狂妄，  我受了鞭伤、刺伤、钉伤，  你怎无伤痕？ 
2 你真无伤痕？ 
 主人如何，仆人该同样，  祂脚被钉，你却无恙，  能否有人真跟随羔羊，  而他无伤痕？ 
552 HAST THOU NO SCAR
1 Hast thou no scar? 
 No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand?  I hear thee sung throughout the land,  I hear them hail thy shining star,  Hast thou no scar? no scar? 
2 Hast thou no wound? 
 Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,  Leaned Me against a tree; and rent  By ravening beasts ‘round Me, I swooned:  Hast thou no wound? no wound? 
3 No wound? no scar? 
 Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,  And pierced the feet that follow Me;  But whole? can he have followed far  Who has no wound nor scar?
553 你若不压橄榄成渣
1 你若不压橄榄成渣，  它就不能成油；
 你若不投葡萄入醡，  它就不能变成酒； 
 你若不炼哪哒成膏，  它就不流芬芳； 
 主，我这人是否也要  受你许可的创伤？ 
和 每次的打击， 
 都是真利益， 
 如果你收去的东西，  你以自己来代替。 
2 你是否要鼓我心弦，  发出你的音乐？ 
 是否要使音乐甘甜，  须有你爱来苦虐？ 
 是否当我下倒之时，  才能识”爱”的心？ 
 我是不怕任何损失，  若你让我来相亲。 
3 主，我惭愧，因我感觉，  总是保留自己， 
 虽我也曾受你雕削，  我却感觉受强逼！ 
 主，你能否照你喜乐，  没有顾忌去行， 
 不顾我的感觉如何，  只是要求你欢欣？ 
4 如果你我所有苦、乐，  不能完全相同， 
 要你喜乐，须我负轭，  我就愿意多苦痛； 
 主，我全心要你所要，  不惜任何代价； 
 你若喜悦，并得荣耀，  我背任何十字架。 
5 我要赞美，再要赞美，  赞美何等甘甜； 
 虽我边赞美边流泪，  甘甜比前更加添； 
 能有什么比你更好？  比你喜悦可宝？ 
 主，我只有一个祷告：  你能加增，我减少。 
553 OLIVES THAT HAVE KNOWN NO  PRESSURE
8.6.8.7.D. WITH CHORUS 
The Way ofthe Cross 
1 Olives that have known no pressure 
 No oil can bestow; 
 If the grapes escape the winepress, 
 Cheering wine can never flow; 
 Spikenard only through the crushing, 
 Fragrance can diffuse. 
 Shall I then, Lord, shrink from suff’ring  Which Thy love for me would choose? 
(C) Each blow I suffer 
 Is true gain to me. 
 In the place of what Thou takest 
 Thou dost give Thyself to me. 
2 Do my heart-strings need Thy stretching,   Songs divine to prove? 
 Do I need for sweetest music 
 Cruel treatment of Thy love? 
 Lord, I fear no deprivation 
 If it draws to Thee; 
 I would yield in full surrender 
 All Thy heart of love to see. 
3 I’m ashamed, my Lord, for seeking. 
 Self to guard alway; 
 Though Thy love has done its stripping,  Yet I’ve been compelled this way. 
 Lord, according to Thy pleasure 
 Fully work on me; 
 Heeding not my human feelings, 
 Only do what pleases Thee. 
4 If Thy mind and mine should differ, 
 Still pursue Thy way; 
 If Thy pleasure means my sorrow, 
 Still my heart shall answer. “Yea!” 
 ‘Tis my deep desire to please Thee, 
 Though I suffer loss; 
 E’en though Thy delight and glory 
 Mean that I endure the cross. 
5 Oh, I’ll praise Thee, e’en if weeping 
 Mingle with my song. 
 Thine increasing sweetness calls forth 
 Grateful praises all day long. 
 Thou hast made Thyself more precious  Than all else to me: 
 Thou increase and I decrease, Lord —   This is now my only plea.
554 我今在地的喜乐
1 我今在地的喜乐， 
 并非无十架生活； 
 乃认识救主大能， 
 使我损失都成圣。 
2 都将临；
 但藉谦卑的信心， 
 得见其中皆是爱， 
 这使喜乐满我怀。 
3 倘若我从未遇见 
 父的管教和试炼， 
 恐怕我就会怀疑： 
 是否我被祂遗弃？ 
4 试炼使应许甘甜； 
 试炼使祷告新鲜； 
 将我带到主脚前， 
 使我谦卑留那边。 
554 ‘TIS MY HAPPINESS BELOW
1 ‘Tis my happiness below 
 Not to live without the cross; 
 But the Savior’s pow’r to know 
 Sanctifying every loss. 
2 Trials must and will befall; 
 But with humble faith to see 
 Love inscribed upon them all —  
 This is happiness to me. 
3 Did I meet no trials here, 
 No chastisement by the way, 
 Might I not with reason fear 
 I should prove a castaway? 
4 Trials make the promise sweet; 
 Trials give new life to prayer; 
 Bring me to my Savior’s feet, 
 Lay me low and keep me there.

555 我们现在都来默思
1 我们现在都来默思 
 葡萄树一生的事： 
 它的道路并不容易， 
 它境遇也不安逸； 
 生长不像野地野花， 
 随地随意自由吐华； 
 也不生成曲径迷堂， 
 或生成款式百样。 
2 反之，当葡萄树开花， 
 是非常渺小无华； 
 人们几乎不能辨省， 
 它竟然也曾有英； 
 花尚未曾开得一日， 
 即已迅速结为果实， 
 它们不得成为骄葩， 
 能自感丰姿可夸。 
3 葡萄藤是栓在桩上， 
 它不能随意生长； 
 它如果想伸肢展臂， 
 也仍是架上被系； 
 它就如此从了砾土， 
 吸取它的养生食物； 
 它并不能自由拣选， 
 也不能遇难思迁。 
4 是的，绿衣何等秀美， 
 给春地披上明媚； 
 因着它生命的丰裕， 
 能自然生长有余； 
 直至满身嫩枝细苗， 
 开始四向飘浮盘绕； 
 伸展在于青蓝空中， 
 品尝其甘美无穷。 
5 但是葡萄园主、园工， 
 对它并不会放松； 
 他们带来刈剪、修刀， 
 要剥除它的骄傲； 
 毫不顾惜它的细嫩， 
 将它割得又深又准， 
 它所有多余的美穗， 
 尽都被断折破碎。 
6 在它被虐、损失期间， 
 它丝毫不敢自怜， 
 乃是反而更将自己， 
 更为完全彻底地 
 交付给那剥夺所有， 
 使它成为虚空的手： 
它并不浪费其生活， 
 一切都是为结果。 
7 它的那些流血的枝， 
 渐渐变坚硬木质； 
 那些存留下来的穗， 
 也渐渐结果累累； 
 太阳又来迫它枯干， 
 它叶开始败落四散， 
 使它的果子变盛紫， 
 直至收成的日子。 
8 它因果实负重过甚， 
 以致几无枝不沉； 
 这是它的长期努力， 
 受尽琢磨换来的； 
现今果实已经全美， 
 自然它可欣喜自慰； 
 但是转眼收成就到， 
 欣慰的日子何少！ 
555 LET US CONTEMPLATE THE GRAPE VINE
1 Let us contemplate the grape vine, 
 From its life now let us learn, 
 How its growth is fraught with suff’ring, 
 Midst environment so stern; 
 How unlike the untamed flowers 
 Growing in the wilderness 
 In a maze of wild confusion, 
 Making patterns numberless. 
2 But the blossoms of the grape vine 
 Without glory are and small; 
 Though they do have some expression, 
 They are hardly seen withal. 
 But a day since they have flowered 
 Into fruit the blooms have grown; 
 Never may they wave corollas 
 With luxuriant beauty shown. 
3 To a post the vine is fastened; 
 Thus it cannot freely grow; 
 When its branches are extended, 
 To the trellis tied they go. 
 To the stony soil committed, 
 Drawing thence its food supply; 
 It can never choose its own way, 
 Or from difficulty fly. 
4 Oh, how beautiful its verdure, 
 Which in spring spreads o’er the field. 
 From life’s energy and fulness 
 Growth abundant doth it yield. 
 Till it’s full of tender branches 
 Twining freely everywhere, 
 Stretching ‘gainst the sky’s deep azure 
 Tasting sweetly of the air. 
5 But the master of the vineyard 
 Not in lenience doth abide, 
 But with knife and pruning scissors 
 Then would strip it of its pride. 
 Caring not the vine is tender, 
 But with deep, precision stroke 
 All the pretty, excess branches 
 From the vine are neatly broke. 
6 In this time of loss and ruin, 
 Dare the vine self-pity show? 
 Nay, it gives itself more fully 
 To the one who wounds it so, 
 To the hand that strips its branches, 
 Till of beauty destitute, 
 That its life may not be wasted, 
 But preserved for bearing fruit. 
7 Into hard wood slowly hardens 
 Every stump of bleeding shoot, 
 Each remaining branch becoming 
 Clusters of abundant fruit. 
 Then, beneath the scorching sunshine, 
 Leaves are dried and from it drop; 
 Thus the fruit more richly ripens 
 Till the harvest of the crop, 
8 Bowed beneath its fruitful burden, 
 Loaded branches are brought low —  
 Labor of its growth thru suff’ring 
 Many a purposed, cutting blow. 
 Now its fruit is fully ripened, 
 Comforted the vine would be; 
 But the harvest soon is coming, 
 And its days of comfort flee.

9 有手要来把果摘下，  还有脚要来践踏，  葡萄所有丰富宝藏，  乃在于酒醡之上，  直到丰富、血红的酒，  浩荡有如长江大流，  终日涌流、溢注不息，  将喜乐充满大地。 10 但是现在葡萄形状，  却变成剥光凄凉：  因它已经给了一切，  今又将进入黑夜，  却无谁人向它偿还  它所给人酣醉之欢，  反而还要将它再砍，  使成无枝的秃干。 11 然而整个寒冬期间，  它的酒却赐甘甜，  给那些在寒冷之中，  忧郁并愁苦之众；  但是葡萄却在外面，  孤独经历雪地冰天，  坚定地忍受着一切，  一切的可疑、难解！ 12 如此直到寒冬已过，  它又要豫备结果，  重新萌芽并且生枝，  再次来放绿成姿；  不因已往所受磨难，  心中有了埋怨不甘；  不因所受损失无限，  而想要减少奉献。 13 它的枝叶所有呼吸，  尽都是高天清气，  从来不曾半点沾染，  不洁的属地情感；  面向牺牲，依然含笑，  再来接受爱的剥削，  有如它从来未遇过  损失、痛苦、和折磨。 14 葡萄树从它的肢枝，  流酒、流血、并流汁，  是否因为已经舍尽，  它就变得更是贫？  世上醉人，人间浪者，  从它畅饮，因它作乐，  是否因着这样享福，  他们就变为更富？ 15 我们估量生命原则，  以失，并不是以得；  并非视你酒饮几多， 乃视你酒倾几何； 
 因为爱的最大能力，  乃是在于爱的舍弃，  谁的苦难受得最深，  就最有，可以给人。 16 谁对待自己最严苛，  就最易为神选择； 
 谁伤害自己最凶狠，  就最能擦人泪痕；  谁不熟练损失、剥夺，  谁就仅是响钹、鸣锣；  谁若是能拯救自己，  谁也就不能乐极。 
9 Hands will pick and feet will trample  All the riches of the vine, 
 Till from out the reddened wine-press  Flows a river full of wine. 
 All the day its flow continues,  Bloody-red, without alloy, 
 Gushing freely, richly, sweetly,  Filling all the earth with joy. 10 In appearance now the grape vine  Barren is and pitiful; 
 Having given all, it enters 
 Into night inscrutable. 
 No one offers to repay it 
 For the cheering wine that’s drunk,  But ‘tis stripped and cut e’en further  To a bare and branchless trunk. 11 Yet its wine throughout the winter  Warmth and sweetness ever bears  Unto those in coldness shiv’ring,  Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.  Yet without, alone, the grape vine  Midst the ice and snow doth stand,  Steadfastly its lot enduring, 
 Though, tis hard to understand. 12 Winter o’er, the vine prepareth  Fruit again itself to bear; 
 Budding forth and growing branches,  Beauteous green again to wear;  Never murmuring or complaining  For the winter’s sore abuse, 
 Or for all its loss desiring 
 Its fresh off’ring to reduce. 
13 Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,  As it lifts its arms on high, 
 Earth’s impure, defiled affections  Ne’er the vine may occupy. 
 Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,  And while love doth prune once more,  Strokes it bears as if it never  Suffered loss and pain before. 14 From the branches of the grape vine  Sap and blood and wine doth flow.  Does the vine, for all it suffered,  Lost, and yielded, poorer grow?  Drunkards of the earth and wanderers,  From it drink and merry make.  From their pleasure and enjoyment  Do they richer thereby wake? 15 Not by gain our life is measured,  But by what we’ve lost ‘tis scored;  ‘Tis not how much wine is drunken,  But how much has been outpoured.  For the strength of love e’er standeth  In the sacrifice we bear; 
 He who has the greatest suff’ring  Ever has the most to share. 
16 He who treats himself severely  Is the best for God to gain; 
 He who hurts himself most dearly  Most can comfort those in pain.  He who suffering never beareth  Is but empty “sounding brass”;  He who self-life never spareth  Has the joys which all surpass.

556 我若稍微偏离正路
1 我若稍微偏离正路， 
 我要立刻舒服； 
 但我纪念我主基督， 
 如何忠心受苦。 
2 我今已经撇弃世界， 
 所有关系都解； 
 虽然道路越走越窄， 
 但我在此是客。 
3 管他世人怒目白眼， 
 我只求主笑脸； 
 群众虽然喜欢外貌， 
 但我要主的”好。”  
4 我心所望不是伟大， 
 不是今生通达； 
 我愿现在卑微事主， 
 那日得祂称祝。 
5 我今每日举目细望 
 审判台前亮光； 
 愿我所有生活、工作，  那日都能耐火。 
6 让你们去得著名声、 
 富足、荣耀、友朋， 
 让你们去得着成功、 
 赞美、从者、兴隆。 
7 但我只愿孤单、贫穷，  在此不求亨通； 
 我心切望忠诚跟从 
 我主到了路终。 
8 因我知道，主在此世 
 不过得着一死， 
 所以现在我无他志， 
 只望与祂损失。 
9 我的荣耀还在将来， 
 今日只得忍耐； 
 我决不肯先我的主 
 在此世界得福。 
10 那日我要得着冠冕， 
 主要拭我泪眼！ 
 今日主既仍旧迟延， 
 我要忠心进前。 
556 IF FROM THE RIGHT COURSE I DEPART
1 If from the right course I depart, 
 Then ease my lot would be; 
 But I remember how my Lord  
 Did suffer agony. 
2 I’ll utterly forsake this world, 
 And sever all its ties. 
 My path may narrow more and more; 
 And all against me rise. 
3 Though men may scowl and laugh to scorn, 
 I only want His smile. 
 His “well done” only I’d secure 
 While here this little while. 
4 Not after greatness do I seek, 
 Nor glory here desire, 
 But humbly I would serve the Lord, 
 His praise that day acquire. 
5 I’m daily gazing at the light 
 Shed from His judgment seat, 
 That all my living and my work 
 The test of fire may meet. 
6 Let others seek for great success, 
 For glory, wealth, and name; 
 Let them procure their grandeur here, 
 Their followers and fame. 
7 In solitude and poverty, 
 Though prospering not in soul, 
 Yet faithfully I’ll follow Him  
 Until I reach the goal. 
8 I know that when on earth He dwelt 
 His lot was but the cross; 
 And that is why I only wish 
 With Him to suffer loss. 
9 Since all my glories lie ahead, 
 I must to patience cleave. 
 I will not go before my Lord 
 And glory here receive. 
10 That day my honors I will have; 
 The Lord will dry my tears. 
 So faithfully I’ll still press on 
 Until my Lord appears.
557 我何喜欢能站立
1 我何喜欢能站立 
 在主十架之下： 
 犹如雄伟磐石荫庇 
 疲倦困苦之涯； 
 又如旷野中的家园， 
 或如路旁凉亭； 
 得以卸下肩头重担， 
 得免炎日侵凌。 
2 这是安全的荫庇， 
 可靠的避难所； 
 是天的爱和天的义 
 彼此相遇之所。 
 当雅各在旷野睡卧， 
 梦见奇妙情景， 
 主的十架今日于我， 
 亦像梯通天庭。 
3 死亡之墓横面前， 
 抹下黑暗阴影； 
 张开巨口，犹如深渊，  令人恐怖、震惊！ 
 幸有十架当中站住， 
 伸展双臂救助， 
 如同守卫，救我脱出 
 极大死亡之墓！ 
4 有时我眼能看见， 
 在主十架之上， 
 有位为我所有过犯， 
 受苦被钉而亡； 
 我从我的震惊心怀， 
 流泪认二奇事： 
 一是，祂的莫测大爱；  一是，我的不值。 
5 十架，我以你荫庇， 
 作我永远住处； 
 我不要求其他福气， 
 除祂面光浴沐。 
 不论利益或是损失， 
 我不介意、苦恼； 
 我的自己是我羞耻， 
 十架是我荣耀。 
557 BENEATH THE CROSS OF JESUS
1 Beneath the cross of Jesus 
 I fain would take my stand, 
 The shadow of a mighty Rock 
 Within a weary land; 
 A home within the wilderness, 
 A rest upon the way, 
 From the burning of the noontide heat,  And the burden of the day. 
2 Oh, safe and happy shelter! 
 Oh, refuge tried and sweet! 
 Oh, trysting place where heaven’s love  And heaven’s justice meet. 
 As to the holy patriarch 
 That wondrous dream was given, 
 So is my Savior by the cross 
 A ladder up to heaven. 
3 There lies beneath its shadow, 
 But on the farther side, 
 The darkness of an awful grave 
 That gapes both deep and wide; 
 And there between us stands the cross,  Two arms outstretched to save, 
 Like a watchman set to guard the way  From that eternal grave. 
4 Upon that cross of Jesus 
 Mine eye at times can see 
 The very dying form of One, 
 Who suffered there for me; 
 And from my smitten heart, with tears,  Two wonders I confess, 
 The wonders of His glorious love, 
 And my own worthlessness. 
5 I take, O cross, thy shadow 
 For my abiding place; 
 I ask no other sunshine than 
 The sunshine of His face; 
 Content’ to let the world go by, 
 To know no gain nor loss, 
 My sinful self my only shame, 
 My glory all the cross.
558 求主使我近十架
1 求主使我近十架！ 
 在此有一宝泉， 
 医治活水，无代价， 
 流自加略山巅。 
和 十字架！十字架！ 
 永是我的夸耀！ 
 在此主付的赎价， 
 是我永远倚靠！ 
2 前我战兢就十架， 
 得蒙爱怜、宽饶； 
 明亮晨星的光华， 
 在此仍将我照。 
3 哦主，当我近十架， 
 示我以其情景； 
 在你十架荫庇下， 
 天天助我前行。 
4 就近十架而儆醒， 
 时时信靠、仰望， 
 直到被提得上升， 
 永远见主面光。 (第二节的“明亮晨星”指主 基督)  
558 JESUS KEEP ME NEAR THE CROSS
1 Jesus, keep me near the cross, 
 There a precious fountain, 
 Free to all — a healing stream, 
 Flows from Calv’ry’s mountain. 
(C) In the cross, in the cross, 
 Be my glory ever; 
 Till my raptured soul shall find 
 Rest with Him forever. 
2 Near the cross, a trembling soul, 
 Love and mercy found me; 
 There the Bright and Morning Star 
 Sheds its beams around me. 
3 Near the cross! O Lamb of God, 
 Bring its scenes before me; 
 Help me walk from day to day, 
 With its shadow o’er me. 
4 Near the cross I’ll watch and wait, 
 Hoping, trusting ever, 
 Till I see my Savior’s face, 
 Leave His presence never.
559 由死而生 - 恩主这乃是说明
1 恩主，这乃是说明，  生命在此，或是在于来世？  不必等候！毁坏破碎的器皿，  即今可在陶人手中陶制。
2 何等奇妙的复活！  种时明感软弱，起时强壮；  你的生命显于劳碌和折磨；  时刻非我，乃是基督我王。
3 客旅道路何孤单，  认识十架者却都愿同行，  效法祂死，他们与祂同苦难，  因祂，就将万事当作有损。
4 何等有福的使命！  从天上的清澈、纯净江河，  带着活泉，生命洋溢又丰盛，  告诉渴人，从兹无需再渴。
559 LIFE OUT OF DEATH DEAR MASTER IS IT  SPOKEN
1 dear Master, is it Spoken
 Of the life here, or in the better land? 
 Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel marred and broken,  Shall now be moulded by the Potter’s hand. 
2 oh, wondrous resurrection!
 Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;  Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction, 
 “Not I, but Christ” in me from hour to hour. 
3 a pilgrim path and lonely,
 Trodden by those who glory in the Cross. 
 They live in fellowship with “Jesus only,” 
 And for His sake count earthly gain but loss. 
4 (No translation)
560 时常携带耶稣的名
1 时常携带耶稣的名，  你们忧愁、困苦人，  祂能赐你安慰、安宁，  除去所有的烦闷。
和 宝贝名，何甘甜！ 
 世之望和天之乐！ 
 宝贝名，何甘甜！ 
 世之望和天之乐。 
2 时常携带耶稣的名，  当作藤牌敌火箭； 
 每逢诱惑扰你心灵，  呼吸这名在心间。 
3 当祂爱手抚摩、安慰，  当我舌头在歌唱， 
 耶稣的名何等宝贝，  使我心头满欢畅。 
4 等到被提、面见救主，  耶稣的名仍颂扬， 
 在祂脚前欢然俯伏，  尊敬祂为王中王。 
560 TAKE THE NAME OF JESUS WITH YOU
1 Take the name of Jesus with you, 
 Child of sorrow and of woe;] 
 It will joy and comfort give you, 
 Take it then where’er you go. 
(C) Precious name! Oh, how sweet! 
 Hope of earth and joy of hear’n; 
 Precious name! Oh, how sweet! 
 Hope of earth and joy of heav’n. 
2 Take the name of Jesus ever, 
 As a shield from every snare. 
 If temptations ‘round you gather,  
 Breathe that holy name in prayer. 
3 Oh, the precious name of Jesus, 
 How it thrills our souls with joy; 
 When His loving arms receive us, 
 And His songs our tongues employ. 
4 At the name of Jesus bowing, 
 Falling prostrate at His feet, 
 King of kings in heav’n we’ll crown Him, 
 When our journey is complete.
561 神阿你名何等广大泱漭
1 神阿，你名何等广大泱漭！  我今投身其中，心顶安然；  有你够了，无论日有多长；  有你够了，无论夜有多暗。 
2 你是我神！全有！全足！全丰！  你能为我创造我所缺乏；  有你自己，在我回家途中，  无论有何需要，都必无差。 
3 我的神阿，你在已过路上，  曾用爱的神迹多方眷顾；  故我敢再投入你的胸膛，  因信心安，赞美你的道路。 
561 DEEP DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THIS  THY NAME
1 Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name, 
 My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight; 
 Thou art enough how ever long the day, 
 Thou art enough however dark the night. 
2 the All-Sufficient One,
 Thou canst create for me whate’er I lack; 
 Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track 
 With miracles of love and tender care. 
3 For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare 
 Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast, 
 And there adore Thy ways in faith’s deep rest, 
 And there adore Thy ways in faith’s quiet rest.
562 非我所是主阿乃你所是
1 非我所是，主阿，乃你所是，  只有这个会叫我心安宁；  你(非我)爱会叫疑惑消失，  会叫起伏心怀风平、波静。 
2 爱既完全，将我疑惧除去  “是我，”这个声音我耳熟悉，  这话给我带来天上欢愉，  喜乐吩咐每一愁烦飞去。 
3 我从十架闻悉：你名是爱！  我从你墓读出：你名是爱！  所有其它的爱都要衰败，  最暗时刻你爱照我心怀。 
4 你今赐福，并要永远赐福，  你今救我，并要永远救我，  你要扶我，在此无倚中途，  你要领我危关平安渡过。 
5 我主、我神！我的对你认识，  使我心满平安，口满歌唱；  你是我的生命、喜乐、杖子，  倚身于你，使我软弱变强。 
6 更多的你，求你时刻启迪，  更多你的荣耀，我主、我神！  更多的你，在于恩典、能力，  更多你的怜悯赐给我身。 
562 NOT WHAT I AM O LORD BUT WHAT THOU  ART
1 Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art; 
 That, that alone, can be my soul’s true rest; 
 Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart, 
 And stills the tempest of my tossing breast. 
2 It is Thy perfect love that casts out fear; 
 I know the voice that speaks the It is I, 
 And in these well-known words of heavenly cheer 
 I hear the joy that bids each sorrow fly. 
3 Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon Cross; 
 Thy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb: 
 All meaner love is perishable dross, 
 But this shall light me through time’s thickest gloom. 
4 It blesses now, and shall for ever bless; 
 It saves me now, and shall for ever save; 
 It holds me up in days of helplessness, 
 It bears me safely o’er each swelling wave. 
5 ‘Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God, 
 That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song; 
 Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod; 
 Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong. 
6 More of Thyself, Oh, show me, hour by hour; 
 More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord; 
 More of Thyself in all Thy grace and power; 
 More of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word.

563 安稳在基督手臂
1 安稳在基督手臂，
 安稳在主怀里； 
 在此祂爱常覆翼， 
 我魂满得安息。 
 这是天来的佳音， 
 慰我惊恐心情， 
 这是众圣的讴吟， 
 我要和声颂称。 
和 安稳在基督手臂， 
 安稳在主怀里； 
 在此祂爱常覆翼， 
 我魂满得安息。 
2 安稳在基督手臂， 
 安稳在主怀里； 
 在此祂恩时临及， 
 犹如甘露滴沥。 
 虽然试炼未全历， 
 眼泪尚余几滴， 
 危难、惊恐或忧疑，  在此莫能我袭。 
3 安稳在基督手臂， 
 安稳在主怀里； 
 永久磐石之圣翼， 
 将我全人遮蔽。 
 在此我耐候依依， 
 直到夜影飞散， 
 直到那可爱晨曦， 
 破晓在我眼前。 
563 SAFE IN THE ARMS OF JESUS
1 Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe on His gentle breast, 
 There by His love o’ershaded, 
 Sweetly my soul doth rest. 
 Hark! ‘tis a song of heaven 
 Borne in the sweetest voice, 
 Echoed by saints in spirit, 
 Making my heart rejoice. 
(C) Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe on His gentle breast, 
 There by His love o’ershaded, 
 Sweetly my soul doth rest. 
2 Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe from corroding care, 
 Safe from the world’s temptations, 
 Sin cannot harm me there. 
 Free from the blight of sorrow, 
 Free from my doubts and fears; 
 Only a few more trials, 
 Only a few more tears. 
3 Jesus, my heart’s dear Refuge, 
 Jesus has died for me; 
 Firm on the Rock of Ages 
 Ever my trust shall be. 
 Here let me wait with patience, 
 Wait till the night is o’er, 
 Wait till I see the morning 
 Break on the golden shore.
564 我必与你同在
1 “我必与你同在，”
 甜美的应许， 
 安慰我的心怀， 
 消除我惊惧； 
 在此幽暗长夜， 
 主是我盾牌， 
 永不将我弃绝， 
 必与我同在。 
和 主与我同在， 
 主与我同在， 
 主曾应许与我同在，  直到永远不离开； 
 直到永远不离开。 
2 四围鲜花败落， 
 主爱不凋残， 
 地上日光灭没， 
 天光仍灿烂； 
 主如一袋没药， 
 整夜在我怀， 
 直到晨曦破晓， 
 必与我同在。 
3 前途虽然艰困， 
 试炼要来临， 
 但主必更亲近， 
 并说：”可放心；”  
 喜乐犹如春鸟， 
 飞入我心怀， 
 使我甜美唱道： 
 “主与我同在！”  
564 FEAR NOT I AM WITH THEE
1 “Fear not, I am with thee”; 
 Blessed golden ray, 
 Like a star of glory, 
 Lighting up my way! 
 Through the clouds of midnight, 
 This bright promise shone, 
 “I will never leave thee, 
 Never will leave thee alone.” 
(C) No, never alone, 
 No, never alone; 
 He promised never to leave me,  Never to leave me alone; 
 Never to leave me alone. 
2 Roses fade around me, 
 Lilies bloom and die, 
 Earthly sunbeams vanish —  
 Radiant still the sky! 
 Jesus, Henna-flower, 
 Blooming for His own, 
 Jesus, heaven’s sunshine, 
 Never will leave me alone. 
3 Steps unseen before me, 
 Hidden dangers near; 
 Nearer still my Savior, 
 Whispering, “Be of cheer”; 
 Joys, like birds of springtime, 
 To my heart have flown, 
 Singing all so sweetly, 
 “He will not leave me alone.”
565 神的行动奇妙、高超
1 神的行动奇妙、高超，  成就使人惊异；

 动用祂的智慧计策， 
 行祂无上旨意。 
3 畏怯圣徒，从此放心！  你们所怕厚云， 
 现在满载神的怜悯， 
 降雨赐你福分！ 
4 莫凭感觉议论主爱， 
 惟要信祂恩典； 
 祂的笑脸常是藏在 
 严厉命定后面。 
5 祂的计划逐渐成熟， 
 正沿时日推展； 
 苞虽难免生涩带苦， 
 花却必定芳甘。 
6 盲目不信必致错失， 
 观察必归徒然； 
 神会自己向人解释， 
 一切都必了然。 
565 GOD MOVES IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY
1 God moves in a mysterious way 
 His wonders to perform: 
 He plants His footsteps in the sea, 
 And rides upon the storm. 
2 Deep in unfathomable mines 
 Of never-failing skill, 
 He treasures up His bright designs, 
 And works His sovereign will. 
3 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take; 
 The clouds ye so much dread 
 Are big with mercy, and shall break 
 In blessings on your head. 
4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 
 But trust Him for His grace; 
 Behind a frowning providence 
 He hides a smiling face. 
5 His purposes will ripen fast, 
 Unfolding every hour: 
 The bud may have a bitter taste, 
 But sweet will be the flower. 
6 Blind unbelief is sure to err, 
 And scan His work in vain; 
 God is His own Interpreter, 
 And He will make it plain.
566 我常居住天爱中
1 我常居住天爱中，
 不怕改变一点； 
 如此把握不落空， 
 在此没有改变。 
 也许狂风四面起， 
 也许无多盼望； 
 但神四面来护庇， 
 我怎能够彷徨！ 
2 穷困难迫我回头， 
 任主领我何方； 
 我不至有何不够， 
 我的牧人在旁。 
 祂的慧心常清醒， 
 祂的明眼不昧； 
 祂知祂行的路径， 
 我要始终跟随。 
3 青草地场尚在前， 
 是我从所未见； 
 再过就是清朗天， 
 今虽稠云绵绵。 
 我的盼望真久长， 
 我的途径光明； 
 救主掌握我宝藏， 
 祂要和我同行。 
566 IN HEAV’NLY LOVE ABIDING
1 In heav’nly love abiding 
 No change my heart shall fear; 
 And safe is such confiding, 
 For nothing changes here. 
 The storm may roar without me, 
 My heart may low be laid; 
 But God is round about me, 
 And can I be dismayed? 
2 Wherever He may guide me, 
 No want shall turn me back; 
 My Shepherd is beside me, 
 And nothing can I lack. 
 His wisdom ever waketh, 
 His sight is never dim; 
 He knows the way He taketh, 
 And I will walk with Him. 
3 Green pastures are before me, 
 Which yet I have not seen; 
 Bright skies will soon be o’er me, 
 Where the dark clouds have been. 
 My hope I cannot measure: 
 My path to life is free: 
 My Savior has my treasure, 
 And He will walk with me.

 愿所唱每首诗歌， 
 是你美事，在你所定时刻。

 God of Impossibilities! 
 Poor puny man, now learn His ways. 
3 The axe did swim on Jordan’s wave! 
 Our God the Red Sea’s waters clave! 
 He stopped the sun! made long the day!  This is the God to whom we pray. 
4 He bars the sea with feeble sand! 
 The proud waves bow at His command!  If God is thine, what more your need? 
 Can He not work for you indeed? 
5 Our God is love; your needs are known;  His promises He’ll fully own. 
 Our gracious God bows down His ear 
 The feeblest, weakest cry to hear. 
6 Our God is light, and never yet, 
 One promise did He e’er forget. 
 His promises in Christ the Son 
 Are fully pledged, Yea and Amen. 
7 Our faithful God, faith cannot break, 
 Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!  Who ask in faith, He’ll not deny; 
 His Word is sure, He must reply. 
8 He faileth not, let all men hear; 
 He faileth not, His Word is clear. 
 He faileth not, His grace how good; 
 He faileth not, for He is God!

 Too deeply for mirth or song, 
 As the burdens press, And the cares distress, 
 And the way grows weary and long?

 His heart is touched with my grief; 
 When the days are weary, 
 The long night dreary, 
 I know my Savior cares. 
2 Does Jesus care when my way is dark 
 With a nameless dread and fear? 
 As the daylight fades Into deep night shades, 
 Does He care enough to be near? 
3 Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed 
 To resist some temptation strong; 
 When for my deep grief There is no relief, 
 Though my tears flow all the night long? 
4 Does Jesus care when I’ve said “goodbye” 
 To the dearest on earth to me, 
 And my sad heart aches Till it nearly breaks, 
 Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

 跋涉遥远的道路；

 引我亲天父。 
 途中虽有乌云笼罩， 
 也有意外的打扰， 
 思虑、烦恼把我压倒，  但我父知道。

 纵然它们随我一生， 
 不容易忍耐。 
 天家在望，莫大鼓励，  使我安息不动摇！ 
 祂的同在何其甜蜜， 
 我天父知道。 
3 我父每日都知道我， 
 看守我在爱里面； 
 艰难来袭，祂来助我，  叫我往上看。 
 不久旅程到达止境， 
 今生就要告终了， 
 我将如何进入光明， 
 这事父知道。

 亲眼看见祂慈颜， 
 满心欢喜，俯伏朝见，  感谢祂恩典。

574 I’M A PILGRIM AND A STRANGER
1 I’m a pilgrim and a stranger, 
 Rough and thorny is the road. 
 Often in the midst of danger, 
 But it leads to God. 
 Clouds and darkness oft distress me, 
 Great and many are my foes; 
 Anxious cares and tho’ts oppress me, 
 But my Father knows. 
2 Oh, how sweet is this assurance, 
 ‘Mid the conflict and the strife! 
 Although sorrows past endurance 
 Follow me through life. 
 Home in prospect still can cheer me, 
 Yes, and give me sweet repose, 
 While I feel His presence near me; 
 For my Father knows. 
3 Yes, He sees and knows me daily, 
 Watches over me in love; 
 Sends me help when foes assail me —  
 Bids me look above. 
 Soon my journey will be ended, 
 Life is drawing to a close; 
 I shall then be well attended; 
 This my Father knows. 
4 I shall then with joy behold Him —  
 Face to face my Father see; 
 Fall with rapture, and adore Him 
 For His love to me. 
 Nothing more shall then distress me 
 In the land of sweet repose; 
 Jesus stands engaged to bless me; 
 This my Father knows.
575 一路我蒙救主引领

 祂有美意不必测。

 Here by faith in Him to dwell! 
 For I know, whate’er befall me, 
 Jesus doeth all things well. 
2 All the way my Savior leads me, 
 Cheers each winding path I tread, 
 Gives me grace for every trial, 
 Feeds me with the living bread. 
 Though my weary steps may falter, 
 And my soul athirst may be, 
 Gushing from the Rock before me, 
 Lo! a spring of joy I see. 
3 All the way my Savior leads me; 
 Oh, the fullness of His grace! 
 Perfect rest to me is promised 
 In my Father’s blest embrace. 
 When my spirit, clothed immortal, 
 Wings its flight to realms of day, 
 This my song through endless ages: 
 Jesus led me all the way.
576 你这奔走天程客旅
1 你这奔走天程客旅，

 神已赐你宝贵应许： 
 “我必用眼引导你。”  
和 “我必引导，我必引导，  我必用眼引导你； 
 你这奔走天程客旅，  我必用眼引导你。”

 可靠亲友也远离， 
 但这应许发出微声： 
 “我必用眼引导你。”  
3 你的隐秘盼望消逝， 
 埋在岁月坟墓里， 
 让这应许将你支持： 
 “我必用眼引导你。”  
4 生命阴影逐渐加深， 
 要穿荣耀的身体， 
 神这应许显为更真： 
 “我必用眼引导你。”

 Thou, the weary passerby, 
 On the way from earth to glory: 
 “I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

 And the hour has come to die, 
 Hear thy faithful Pilot calling, 
 “I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

1 不在此时，许待那日，  我们与主同在一起；  那时才能完全认识
 叹息、眼泪所有意义。 
和 你当一生信靠救主，  路虽阴暗，仍当赞美，  不必惧怕，主在搀扶，  有日、有日都要领会。 
2 中断线索，都将接上，  一生经过，必有路轨，  天能解释各样秘藏，  那日、那日都必领会。 
3 何故厚云遮蔽太阳？  何故寂寞代替安慰？  何故叹息多过歌唱？  有日我们就要领会。 
4 何以祈求未见答应？  何以将成终又不遂？  何以盼望终成泡影？  那日那时，我必领会。 
5 神知我路，手拿它钥，  祂的带领充满智慧；  有日我眼看见一切，  到了那日，我必领会。 
577 NOT NOW BUT IN THE COMING YEARS
1 Not now, but in the coming years, 
 It may be when with Christ we stand, 
 We’ll read the meaning of our tears, 
 And there, sometime, we’ll understand. 
(C) Then trust in God through all thy days; 
 Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
 Though dark thy way, still sing and praise, 
 Sometime, sometime, we’ll understand. 
2 We’ll catch the broken thread again, 
 And finish what we here began; 
 God will the mysteries explain, 
 And then, ah, then, we’ll understand. 
3 We’ll know why clouds instead of sun 
 Were over many a cherished plan; 
 Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
 ‘Tis then, sometime, we’ll understand. 
4 Why what we long for most of all, 
 Eludes so oft our eager hand; 
 Why hopes are crushed and castles fall, 
 Till then, sometime, we’ll understand. 
5 God knows the way, He holds the key, 
 He guides us with unerring hand; 
 Sometime with tearless eyes we’ll see; 
 Yes, then, ‘tis then, we’ll understand.
578 前途如何我不知
1 特.和.
安慰与鼓励──因着信靠主 1 前途如何我不知， 
 神将我眼遮蔽； 
 在我向前每步路上，  都有新的境地； 
 祂所赐的每一喜乐，  也都令人惊奇。 
和 我愿跟随祂带领， 
 对祂完全信靠； 
 随时随在安然唱道：  “祂知道，祂知道；”   随时随在安然唱道：  “祂知道，祂知道。”  
2 眼前一步我所见， 
 已够应付需要； 
 属地幻想若肯去掉 
 天光就必照耀； 
 静中也必甜然听见：  “你要将我信靠。”  
3 哦，那有福的”无智”，  “不知”真是福气！ 
 祂用右手将我握住，  不肯让我稍离， 
 并使我的受惊心魂 
 在祂爱中安息。 
4 如此不知而向前； 
 能知，我也不愿； 
 宁愿暗中与神同行，  不愿光中孤单； 
 宁愿凭信与神同行，  不愿凭着眼见。 
578 I KNOW NOT WHAT AWAITS ME IRREGULAR METER WITH CHORUS
1 I know not what awaits me, 
 God kindly veils my eyes, 
 And o’er each step of my onward way  He makes new scenes to rise; 
 And every joy He sends me comes 
 A sweet and glad surprise. 
(C) Where He may lead I’ll follow, 
 My trust in Him repose; 
 And every hour in perfect peace, 
 I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”; 
 And every hour in perfect peace, 
 I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.” 
2 One step I see before me, 
 ‘Tis all I need to see, 
 The light of heaven more brightly shines  When earth’s illusions flee; 
 And sweetly through the silence comes,  His loving, “Trust in Me!” 
3 Oh, blissful lack of wisdom, 
 ‘Tis blessed not to know; 
 He holds me with His own right hand,  And will not let me go, 
 And lulls my troubled soul to rest 
 In Him who loves me so. 
4 So on I go not knowing; 
 I would not if I might; 
 I’d rather walk in the dark with God 
 Than go alone in the light; 
 I’d rather walk by faith with Him 
 Than go alone by sight.
579 我心安静这些挂虑
1 我心，安静！这些挂虑，  是你重担、陷阱、荆棘；  使主蒙羞，圣灵担忧，  使主恩言不得成就。 
2 祂手领你至今安然，  是何使你畏惧胆寒？  有祂供应，何来缺乏？  有祂引领，必不会差！ 
3 当你初次到祂恩座，  已将一切全都交托；  那时祂已给你保证，  信靠祂的爱心、权能。 
4 曾否当你遇见难处，  而祂对你呼求不顾？  祂岂未曾给你应许，  使你至终得胜有余。 
5 直到如今祂仍帮助，  余下路程祂岂不顾，  使我天天经历、称说，  “以便以谢，”赞祂不辍。 
6 路虽崎岖，荆棘满布，  引你加速前来见父；  今日所受至轻苦楚，  将来神要为你补足。 
579 BE STILL MY HEART THESE ANXIOUS  CARES
1 Be still, my heart! these anxious cares 
 To thee are burdens, thorns and snares; 
 They cast dishonor on the Lord, 
 And contradict His gracious word. 
2 Brought safely by His hand thus far, 
 Why wilt thou now give place to fear? 
 How canst thou want if He provide, 
 Or lose thy way with such a Guide? 
3 When first before His mercy-seat 
 Thou didst to Him thine all commit; 
 He gave thee warrant from that hour 
 To trust His wisdom, love, and power. 
4 Did ever trouble yet befall, 
 And He refuse to hear thy call? 
 And has He not His promise passed, 
 That thou shalt overcome at last? 
5 He who has helped me hitherto 
 Will help me all my journey through, 
 And give me daily cause to raise 
 New Ebenezers to His Praise. 
6 Though rough and thorny be the road, 
 It leads thee on, apace, to God; 
 Then count thy present trials small, 
 For God will make amends for all.
580 当你经过试炼茫然无所从
1 当你经过试炼，茫然无所从，  你心绝望，以为什么都失踪；  就当数主祝福，当一一的数，  你就要希奇祂曾如何眷顾。
和 数主祝福！要一一的数！  记看祂曾如何眷顾你！  数主祝福！要一一的数！  你就要希奇祂曾如何爱你。 
2 当你有所挂虑，如同挑重担，  觉得你所负的十架苦难堪，  你若数主祝福，疑惑要消散，  并要不止住的欢乐和颂赞。 
3 当你看见别人属世的亨通，  你若念主应许，心就不会动；  你所受的祝福，原来无处买，  你有了父的家，又有主的爱。 
4 所以，无论遇见大小的试探，  不必灰心，万事总有主承担，  你若数主祝福，天使要来临，  伺候你，服侍你，直到你路尽。 
580 WHEN UPON LIFE’S BILLOWS YOU ARE  TEMPEST TOSSED
11.11.11.11. WITH CHORUS 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,  When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost, 
 Count your many blessings name them one by one,  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. 
(C) Count your blessings, name them one by one; 
 Count your blessings, see what God hath done;  Count your blessings, name them one by one, 
 And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. 
2 Are you ever burdened with a load of care? 
 Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?  Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,  And you will be singing as the days go by. 
3 When you look at others with their lands and gold,  Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.  Count your many blessings, money cannot buy 
 Your reward in heaven, nor your Lord on high. 
4 So amid the conflict, whether great or small, 
 Do not be discouraged, God is over all; 
 Count your many blessings, angels will attend, 
 Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.
581 每一天所度过每一时刻
1 每一天所度过每一时刻，  我获得力量胜过试炼；  我信靠我天父智慧所赐，  无理由再忧虑并挂念。  祂心仁慈远超一切度量，  逐日领受祂手所量给；  忧或喜都显明祂的慈爱，  劳苦中融主安慰。 
2 每一天，主自己与我相亲，  每时刻赐下应时怜悯；  每重担主甘愿背负、鼓舞，  祂名称为策士、全能君。  主保护祂儿女如同珍宝，  祂亲身担负这个使命；  “你能力必像你日子一般，”   这是祂所赐保证。 
3 每试炼都彰显救主恩助，  我只要信靠宝贵应许；  祂安慰，使我更信心坚定，  供应我以你神圣话语。  每一次我遇见痛苦患难，  都愿从父手欢然接受；  每件事随时光如水逝去，  直到我见主时候。 
581 DAY BY DAY AND WITH EACH PASSING  MOMENT
1 Day by day, and with each passing moment, 
 Strength I find to meet my trials here; 
 Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment, 
 I’ve no cause for worry or for fear. 
 He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure, 
 Gives unto each day what He deems best, 
 Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure, 
 Mingling toil with peace and rest. 
2 Every day the Lord Himself is near me, 
 With a special mercy for each hour; 
 All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me, 
 He whose name is Counsellor and Pow’r. 
 The protection of His child and treasure 
 Is a charge that on Himself He laid; 
 “As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,” 
 This the pledge to me He made. 
3 Help me then, in every tribulation, 
 So to trust Thy promises, O Lord, 
 That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation, 
 Offered me within Thy holy Word. 
 Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, 
 E’er to take, as from a father’s hand, 
 One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, 
 Till with Christ the Lord I stand.
582 历经人世诸多变故
1 历经人世诸多变故，  喜乐或是痛苦， 
 我心、我口仍要赞美  我神所赐恩惠。 
2 与我同将恩主称颂，  同来高举主名； 
 当我为难，向祂呼求，  祂立前来拯救。 
3 神的使者四围安营，  卫护义人居所； 
 凡信靠祂救拔的人，  祂必拯救解脱。 
4 所有试炼出自祂爱，  故当凭信依赖， 
 事实经验都必证实，  靠祂何等有福。 
5 圣徒们哪，当敬畏祂，  才能无所惧怕； 
 当以服事祂为喜乐，  就必满被恩泽。 
582 THROUGH ALL THE CHANGING SCENES OF  LIFE
1 Through all the changing scenes of life, 
 In trouble and in joy, 
 The praises of my God shall still 
 My heart and tongue employ. 
2 Oh, magnify the Lord with me, 
 With me exalt His name; 
 When in distress to Him I called, 
 He to my rescue came. 
3 The hosts of God encamp around 
 The dwellings of the just; 
 Deliverance He affords to all 
 Who on His succor trust. 
4 Oh, make but trial of His love, 
 Experience will decide 
 How blest they are, and only they, 
 Who in His truth confide. 
5 Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then 
 Have nothing else to fear; 
 Make you His service your delight, 
 Your wants shall be His care.
583 当我在路上正遇见试探时
1 当我在路上正遇见试探时， 
 撒但在耳边细语叫我放弛； 
 但是担虽重我仍然不发愁， 
 只要一点信就赶逐难处走。 
和 主，我相信！主，我相信！  求提高我信你的心，使我能以移山；  主，我相信！主，我相信！  我的疑虑全投在你身畔。 
2 当我航行在平静海的时候， 
 何等容易信耶和华的能手， 
 但当我发现波浪正漫船来， 
 需要好多信才能够不沉埋。 
3 我常听人说，”我坚持直到底，  我要尽忠心至死地不逃避。”   但当大试探凶狠地临到时， 
 他就失信心，所有的都丧失。 
4 还有一些人富勇敢与热心， 
 他们事奉主就好像钢铁人， 
 但是与罪恶相搏斗激烈时， 
 他们失信心只因为怕损失。 
5 我们当记得，奔跑这属天路，  凭信，非感觉；乃信靠，非摸触。  正当你四围一切都不见时， 
 我们仍要信，直向前不推辞。 
583 WHEN SORROWS AND STORMS ARE  BESETTING MY TRACK
11.11.11.11. WITH CHORUS 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 When sorrows and storms are besetting my track,  And Satan is whip’ring “You’d better go back,”  Oh, then I have prov’d it tho’ dark be the way,  A little believing drives clouds right away. 
(C) Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe! 
 Savior, raise my faith in Thee till it can move a mountain.  Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe! 
 All my doubts I’ll bury in the Fountain. 
2 How easy when sailing the sea at a calm 
 To trust in the strength of Jehovah’s great arm,  But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat,  It takes some believing to keep things afloat. 
3 “I’ll stand to the end,” I have heard people say,  “I’ll fight till I die, and I’ll ne’er run away;”  But when the temptations so fiercely assailed,  They left off believing, and terribly failed. 
4 And others there are full of courage and zeal,  Who go to the battle like warriors of steel; 
 But right in the heat of the conflict with sin,  Instead of believing, they faint and give in. 
5 Oh, let us remember, in running our race, 
 That faith is not feeling, and trust is not trace;  And when all is seeming as black as the night,  We’ll keep on believing, and go on with the fight.
584 再唱信心的歌
1 再唱信心的歌！
 即或夜黑如墨； 
 你若赞美，神要工作，  使你所信能得； 
 使你所信能得； 
2 再唱信心的歌！ 
 你魂应当赞颂； 
 因神喜悦信心唱歌，  于漫漫长夜中； 
 于漫漫长夜中； 
3 再唱信心的歌！ 
 仇敌听见要抖； 
 赞美原来会胜鬼魔，  何致被他箝口； 
 何致被他箝口； 
4 再唱信心的歌！ 
 不久天就要曙， 
 我们要唱无终的歌，  我们要去见主；。 
 我们要去见主；。 
584 KEEP UP THE SONG OF FAITH
1 Keep up the song of faith, 
 However dark the night; 
 And as you praise, the Lord will work  To change your faith to sight. 
 To change your faith to sight. 
2 Keep up the song of faith, 
 And let your heart be strong, 
 For God delights when faith can praise  Though dark the night and long. 
 Though dark the night and long. 
3 Keep up the song of faith, 
 The foe will hear and flee; 
 Oh, let not Satan hush your song, 
 For praise is victory. 
 For praise is victory. 
4 Keep up the song of faith, 
 The dawn will break ere long, 
 And we shall go to meet the Lord, 
 And join the endless song. 
 And join the endless song.
585 哦让我们在主里面常喜乐
1 哦，让我们在主里面常喜乐，  虽然四围充满了凶恶，
 虽然患难如同波涛在冲击，  但是歌唱总胜似叹息。 
和 应当时常喜乐，当时常喜乐，  无论如何，歌唱总胜叹息，  无论如何，生存总胜死寂，  所以应当时常喜乐！ 
2 哦，让我们在主里面常喜乐，  虽然火箭暗中频频戳， 
 因为撒但还是像从前那样  惧怕赞美远过于悲伤。 
3 哦，让我们在主里面常喜乐，  虽然精神在病中消磨； 
 因为主的喜乐是你的力量，  若靠主喜乐，就必刚强。 
585 O LET US REJOICE IN THE LORD  EVERMORE
11.9.11.9. WITH CHORUS 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore, 
 Though all things around us be trying, 
 Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,  It’s better to sing than be sighing. 
(C) Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,  It is better to sing than be sighing: 
 It is better to live than be dying; 
 So let us rejoice evermore. 
2 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore, 
 When the darts of the tempter are flying,  For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,  Our singing much more than our sighing. 
3 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore, 
 When sickness upon us is stealing, 
 No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,  For joy is the fountain of healing.
586 神的完全平安
1 神的完全平安，畅流如江河；  漫过各种艰难，越过越显多。  奇妙、甜美平安，天天畅流过；
 奇妙、甜美平安，越流越深阔。 
和 我心完全靠主， 
 祝福何其多； 
 照祂应许吩咐， 
 平安永归我！ 
2 何等的护庇！  仇敌无法追踪， 对头难站立。  无担忧的波涛， 无挂虑黑影，  无忙乱的风暴， 能搅扰我灵。
3 每一喜乐、忧伤， 都是从天降；  随着爱的太阳， 画我晷仪上。  我的所有办法， 就是全心信；  谁全心信靠祂， 必识祂全真。 
586 LIKE A RIVER GLORIOUS
1 Like a river, glorious Is God’s perfect peace,  Over all victorious In its bright increase;  Perfect, yet it floweth Fuller every day,  Perfect, yet it growth Deeper all the way. 
(C) Stayed upon Christ Jesus, 
 Hearts are fully blest; 
 Finding, as He promised, 
 Perfect peace and rest. 
2 Hidden in the hollow Of His blessed hand,  Never foe can follow, Never traitor stand;  Not a surge of worry, Not a shade of care,  Not a blast of hurry Touch the spirit there. 
3 Every joy or trial Falleth from above,  Traced upon our dial By the Sun of Love.  We may trust Him fully All for us to do;  They who trust Him wholly Find Him wholly true.
587 黑暗罪世那有真正平安
1 黑暗罪世，那有真正平安？  靠主宝血，心中就能安然。 
2 人生忙碌，那有真正平安？  遵行主旨，万事皆能安然。 
3 愁烦侵扰，那有真正平安？  在主怀里，逆境中仍安然。 
4 亲人离散，那有真正平安？  交主保守，彼此都享平安。 
5 未来渺茫，那有真正平安？  我知我主，祂仍安定在天。 
587 PEACE PERFECT PEACE IN THIS DARK  WORLD OF SIN
1 Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?  The blood of Jesus whispers peace within. 
2 this is rest.
3 Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?  On Jesus’ bosom naught but calm is found. 
4 Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?  In Jesus’ keeping we are Safe, and they. 
5 Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown? 
 Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
588 我要歌唱那奇妙应许
1 我要歌唱那奇妙应许，
 就是耶稣亲口所说： 
 “我的恩典是够你使用， 
 我的能力显于软弱。”  
 惟恐我这恶心会忘记， 
 忘记这应许的光荣， 
 所以祂一直一直的说： 
 “我的恩典够你使用。”  
和 是的，救主一直对我说，  一直，一直，一直的说：  “我的恩典是够你使用，  我的能力显于软弱。”  
2 祂的恩典够使我得救， 
 脱离罪恶，得着新心； 
 够使我灵、魂、体都圣洁，  并且满有主的圣灵。 
 祂的恩典够助我经过 
 各种试炼，无论多凶； 
 祂的应许抵挡了它们， 
 “我的恩典够你使用。”  
3 祂的恩典够为我疾病： 
 一面扶持，一面施医。 
 祂的恩典够助我经过 
 一切苦楚、一切攻击。 
 祂的恩典是够我工作， 
 使我能够帮助弟兄， 
 并使他们与我同知道， 
 祂的恩典足够使用。 
4 祂的恩典是够我生活； 
 若是我须经过死谷， 
 祂的恩典仍发光照亮， 
 一路引领，直到见主。 
 到那时当我看见救主 -  
 祂的美丽、祂的光荣， 
 我就要俯伏并承认说： 
 你的恩典够我使用。 
5 我们的恩典并不够用， 
 够用，惟有祂的恩典。 
 我们的，常是昙花一现， 
 但是祂的，永不改变。 
 因此我就不断的背诵 
 祂曾对我亲口所说： 
 “我的恩典是够你使用， 
 我的能力显于软弱。” 
588 I’LL SING OF THE WONDERFUL PROMISE
1 I’ll sing of the wonderful promise 
 That Jesus has given to me; 
 “My strength is made perfect in weakness, 
 My grace is sufficient for thee.” 
 And lest my poor heart should forget it, 
 Or ever forgetful should be, 
 He still keeps repeating the promise, 
 My grace is sufficient for thee. 
(C) Yes, over and over and over, 
 My Savior keeps saying to me; 
 My strength is made perfect in weakness, 
 My grace is sufficient for thee. 
2 His grace is sufficient to save me, 
 And cleanse me from guilt and from sin; 
 Sufficient to sanctify wholly, 
 And give me His Spirit within. 
 His grace is sufficient for trials, 
 No matter how hard they may be, 
 This promise stands over against them, 
 My grace is sufficient for thee. 
3 His grace is sufficient for sickness, 
 Sustaining and making me whole; 
 His grace is sufficient when sorrows 
 Like billows roll over the soul. 
 His grace is sufficient for service, 
 It sets us from selfishness free, 
 And sends us to tell to the tried ones, 
 His grace is sufficient for thee. 
4 His grace is sufficient to live by, 
 And should we be summoned to die 
 ‘Twill light up the valley of shadows, 
 And bear us away to Him nigh. 
 Or when we shall stand in His vict’ry, 
 And Christ in His glory shall see, 
 We’ll fall at His footstool confessing, 
 Thy grace was sufficient for me. 
5 I t is not our grace that’s sufficient, 
 But His grace, it ever must be: 
 Our graces are transient and changing; 
 His grace is unfailing as He. 
 And so I am ever repeating 
 His wonderful promise to me, 
 My strength is made perfect in weakness, 
 My grace is sufficient for thee.
589 神未曾应许天色常蓝
1 神未曾应许：天色常蓝，
 人生的路途花香常漫； 
 神未曾应许：常晴无雨， 
 常乐无痛苦，常安无虞。 
和 神却曾应许：生活有力，  行路有光亮，作工得息，  试炼得恩勖，危难有赖，  无限的体谅，不死的爱。 
2 神未曾应许：我们不遇 
 苦难和试探、懊恼、忧虑；  神未曾应许：我们不负 
 许多的重担、许多事务。 
3 神未曾应许：前途尽是 
 平坦的大路，任意驱驰； 
 没有深水拒，汪洋一片， 
 没有大山阻，高薄云天。 
589 GOD HATH NOT PROMISED SKIES  ALWAYS BLUE
9.9.9.9. WITH CHORUS 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 God hath not promised skies always blue,  Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;  God hath not promised sun without rain, 
 Joy without sorrow, peace without pain. 
(C) But God hath promised strength for the day,  Rest for the labor, light for the way, 
 Grace for the trials, help from above, 
 Unfailing sympathy, undying love. 
2 God hath not promised we shall not know  Toil and temptation, trouble and woe; 
 He hath not told us we shall not bear 
 Many a burden, many a care. 
3 God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,  Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;  
 Never a mountain, rocky and steep, 
 Never a river, turbid and deep.
590 祂赐的十架虽然沉重
1 祂赐的十架虽然沉重，
 不会重逾祂恩典； 
 我怕的风波虽然汹涌， 
 不致掩蔽祂荣脸。 
和 十架不会重逾祂恩典， 
 风波不会掩蔽祂荣脸； 
 我心欢乐，因我知有主耶稣同在此，  我就胜过敌权势。 
2 我路上荆棘，并不会比 
 祂头上的荆冕利； 
 我喝的苦杯，还远不及 
 祂的在客西马尼。 
3 祂光照耀得更加昭明， 
 在危难的道路中； 
 我担子变得更为省轻， 
 当我为人来任重。 
4 我今生活在祂的面前， 
 欢然顺服祂旨意； 
 我知我所受各种试炼， 
 都是化装的福庇。 
590 THE CROSS THAT HE GAVE MAY BE HEAVY
1 The cross that He gave may be heavy, 
 But it ne’er outweighs His grace; 
 The storm that I feared may surround me, 
 But it ne’er excludes His face. 
(C) The cross is not greater than His grace, 
 The storm cannot hide His blessed face; 
 I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below,  I can conquer every foe. 
2 The thorns in my path are not sharper 
 Than composed His crown for me; 
 The cup that I drink not more bitter 
 Than He drank in Gethsemane. 
3 The light of His love shineth brighter, 
 As it falls on paths of woe; 
 The toil of my work groweth lighter, 
 As I stoop to raise the low. 
4 His will I have joy in fulfilling, 
 As I’m walking in His sight; 
 My trials more blessings are bringing, 
 Christ in them is my delight.
591 每当负担加重主赐更多恩典
1 每当负担加重，主赐更多恩典；  劳苦加多时，祂的力量加添。  更多遭受苦难，就得更多慈怜；  加倍的试炼，就有加倍平安。 
2 每当我们用尽自己库存忍耐，  日课未及半，力量几已耗殆，  每当我们到达积蓄资源尽头，  我父的丰富供应才刚起首。 
3 祂的大爱无限，祂恩无法测度，  祂无穷大能，无人完全领悟，  从在基督里的无限丰富宝库，  祂不断赐福、赐福又再赐福。 
591 HE GIVETH MORE GRACE WHEN THE  BURDENS GROW GREATER
1 He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,  He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,  To added affliction He addeth His mercy, 
 To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace. 
2 When we have exhausted our store of endurance,  When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,  When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,  Our Father’s full giving is only begun. 
3 His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,  His power no boundary known unto men, 
 For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, 
 He giveth and giveth and giveth again.

592 我是一只笼中小鸟
1 我是一只笼中小鸟， 
 远离天空、旷阔野地； 
 是祂将我安置于此， 
 我愿向祂歌颂不已； 
 如此被囚，我甚欢欣， 
 因这，我神，使你称心。 
2 禁中我无他事可作， 
 终日只是欢然歌唱； 
 我所使之称心的神， 
 也在倾听我的颂扬； 
 祂捆绑了我的翅膀， 
 却爱俯首听我歌唱。 
3 哦神，你是有耳能听， 
 你也有心施爱赐福； 
 我的音调虽然粗陋， 
 你却毫不鄙弃厌恶； 
 因你知这音调之弦， 
 乃是甜美之爱所弹。 
4 这笼将我四面禁锢， 
 我难外飞任意遨游； 
 我的翅膀虽被捆住， 
 我心我灵仍是自由； 
 监牢墙垣，不能阻挡 
 心灵所有释放、翱翔。 
5 我心超越监牢之闩， 
 我灵腾飞何其自在！ 
 向着心爱之主腾飞， 
 祂的旨意我所敬拜； 
 在你坚定旨意之中， 
 我灵得到自由、欢腾。 
592 A LITTLE BIRD I AM
1 A little bird I am, 
 Shut from the fields of air, 
 And in my cage I sit and sing 
 To Him who placed me there; 
 Well pleased a prisoner to be, 
 Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee. 
2 Nought have I else to do,  
 I sing the whole day long; 
 And He whom most I love to please  Doth listen to my song; 
 He caught and bound my wandering wing;  But still He bends to hear me sing. 
3 Thou hast an ear to hear 
 A heart to love and bless; 
 And though my notes were e’er so rude,  Thou wouldst not hear the less;  Because Thou knowest as they fall,  That love, sweet love, inspires them all. 
4 My cage confines me round; 
 Abroad I cannot fly; 
 But though my wing is closely bound,  My heart’s at liberty; 
 For prison walls cannot control  The flight, the freedom of the soul. 
5 O it is good to soar 
 These bolts and bars above! 
 To Him whose purpose I adore,  Whose providence I love; 
 And in Thy mighty will to find 
 The joy, the freedom of the mind.

593 四围墙垣坚而固
1 四围墙垣坚而固， 
 终日将我禁闭； 
 但那关闭我的人， 
 不能使神远离： 
 监牢墙垣全变可爱， 
 因为我神在此同在。 
2 关闭我者都知道， 
 甚难使我孤单； 
 但是他们却不知 
 是祂来狱慰安； 
 祂使牢中黑暗变明， 
 并用喜乐充满我灵。 
3 哦神，你爱激动我， 
 悲叹转为颂赞； 
 我从深处敬拜你， 
 不管时间、地点； 
 或顺或逆，都无所求， 
 只求和你旨意相投。 
4 这个成为我宝贝， 
 这个使我得益； 
 为我将祸变祝福， 
 使我苦中欢喜。 
 不论何事都可临到， 
 只要有神我就够了。 
593 STRONG ARE THE WALLS AROUND ME
1 Strong are the walls around me, 
 That hold me all the day; 
 But they who thus have bound me, 
 Cannot keep God away: 
 My very dungeon walls are dear, 
 Because the God I love is here, 
2 They know, who thus oppress me, 
 ‘Tis hard to be alone; 
 But know not One can bless me, 
 Who comes through bars and stone; 
 He makes my dungeon’s darkness bright, 
 And fills my bosom with delight.  
3 Thy love, O God, restores me 
 From sighs and tears to praise; 
 And deep my soul adores Thee, 
 Nor thinks of time or place: 
 I ask no more, in good or ill, 
 But union with Thy holy will. 
4 ‘Tis that which makes my treasure, 
 ‘Tis that which brings my gain; 
 Converting woe to pleasure, 
 And reaping joy from pain. 
 Oh, ‘tis enough, whate’er befall, 
 To know that God is All in all.
594 迫得太紧迫得无处可逃生
1 迫得太紧，迫得无处可逃生；  迫到极点，好像力不能胜；  压迫在身，无处可算是平安；  压迫在心，四围都是黑暗。
和 神是我盼望，是我喜乐；  是祂使无变有，叫死人复活！ 
2 迫于仇敌，有时也迫于朋友；  迫上加迫，性命几归乌有。  迫到除神之外，别无人帮助；  迫到接受鞭杖，如蒙雨露。 
3 主里的生命，  得享基督生命，何等丰盈！
594 PRESSED OUT OF MEASURE PRESSED  BEYOND ALL LENGTH
10.10.10.10. WITH CHORUS 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;  Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;  Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul, 
 Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll. 
(C) God is my hope and God is my joy; 
 He is the resurrection life I enjoy. 
2 Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;  Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends; 
 Pressed into knowing none to help but God, 
 Pressed into loving both the staff and rod. 
3 Pressed into liberty where nothing clings, 
 Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;  Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord, 
 Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.
595 祂的脸面祂的天使常看见
1 祂的脸面，祂的天使常看见，  但不认识祂的大爱；
 祂的圣徒虽然认识爱无限，  却未看见祂的丰采。 
 他们不久也要看见祂脸面，  认识祂的荣耀光明； 
 但马利亚曾看见祂的泪眼，  知道祂心痛的情形。 
 知道祂心痛的情形。 
2 我们快要完全知道我们主，  已往从未如此知道； 
 但是今日医治伤心的摸抚，  不是天上感觉得到。 
 那日虽有无穷无尽的赞美，  却无流泪迫切祷告， 
 却无伤心痛苦所得的安慰，  也无困难所生倚靠。 
 也无困难所生倚靠。 
3 那日虽有无比荣耀的冠冕，  但无十架可以顺从； 
 祂为我们所受一切的磨碾，  今日才能与祂交通。 
 进入安息，就再寻不到疲倦，  再无机会为祂受苦； 
 再也不能为祂经过何试炼，  再为祂舍弃何幸福。 
 再为祂舍弃何幸福。 
4 哎呀，为祂，机会已是何等少，  所有机会快要过去， 
 机会无多，为祂，蒙羞和受嘲，  为祂，再来分心、分虑。 
 不久就无误会、怒?与凌辱，  就无孤单、寂寞、离别； 
 我当宝贝这些不久的祝福，  我藉这些与你联结。 
 我藉这些与你联结。 
5 主，我羡慕早日看见你脸面，  那是实在好得无比； 
 但是，我也不愿免去你试炼，  失去如此交通甜蜜。 
 求你怜悯，使我充满你大爱，  不顾一切为你生活； 
 免你仆人今天急切望将来，  将来又悔今天错过。 
将来又悔今天错过。 
595 HIS ANGELS HIS COUNTENANCE ALWAYS  BEHOLD
11.8.11.8.D. WITH REPEAT 
Comfort and Encouragement 
1 His angels His countenance always behold, 
 But never experience His grace; 
 His saints, while they know His unlimited love, 
 Have never yet looked on His face. 
 Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold, 
 The sight of His glory will gain; 
 But Mary, beholding His tear-be-dimmed eyes, 
 Could see His heart’s anguish and pain, 
 Could see His heart’s anguish and pain. 
2 We soon will see Jesus, our Lord, face to face, 
 We’ll know Him as never before; 
 But then there’s no need for a hand such as His 
 To heal a heart broken and sore. 
 In heaven we’ll offer Him praise without end —  
 No praying or tears needed there, 
 Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend, 
 Or place for importunate prayer, 
 Or place for importunate prayer. 
3 In heavenly glory, that day we’ll be crowned 
 And nevermore carry a cross. 
 ‘Tis only on earth where our Lord was disowned 
 We share His rejection and loss. 
 When entering rest in that morning so fair, 
 Our anguish and trials will end; 
 His sorrow and shame we’ll no more with Him share,  Or sacrifice pleasures for Him, 
 Or sacrifice pleasures for Him. 
4 Alas, we are left with few chances to share, 
 To learn and to taste of His grief. 
 Yet still for His sake His reproach we may bear —   Such times we can never retrieve. 
 Reviling and scorn shall we still here bemoan 
 When soon they no longer will be? 
 I treasure these temporal blessings I’ve known, 
 For thus, Lord, I’m made one with Thee, 
 For thus, Lord, I’m made one with Thee. 
5 I long, Lord, to gaze on Thy wonderful face-  
 ‘Tis better by far Thee to meet. 
 But now I would choose Thy dear suffering grace 
 And not miss such fellowship sweet. 
 Have mercy on me; fill me, Lord, with Thy love 
 To live for Thee here at all cost, 
 Lest earnestly seeking a heaven above 
 I then regret chances were lost, 
 I then regret chances were lost.
596 为何惧怕黑暗时光
1 为何惧怕黑暗时光，  或被试探能力惊慌？  既有耶稣在我身旁。 
2 战争虽凶，为何退缩？  为何必须投降逃脱？  既有耶稣挡住敌火。 
3 人的安慰，逐渐消失，  世人哀哭，我何如斯？  祂仍亲近，祂仍在此。 
4 棚内无牛、圈内绝羊，  但我魂仍不惧饥荒，  因耶稣是我生命粮。 
5 我不知将遇何事故，  或我缺乏如何应付，  但祂知道，并能补足。 
6 虽然罪恶令我苦恼，  但我仍敢座前祈祷，  因有耶稣作我中保。 
7 祷告无力，爱心冷淡，  但我盼望坚定不变，  因主为我代求在天。 
8 世界、地狱联手攻击，  神圣能力伴我不离，  主是一切，祂是我的！ 
596 WHY SHOULD I FEAR THE DARKEST HOUR
1 Why should I fear the darkest hour, 
 Or tremble at the tempter’s power? 
 Jesus vouchsafes to be my tower. 
2 Though hot the fight, why quit the field? 
 Why must I either fly or yield, 
 Since Jesus is my mighty shield? 
3 When creature comforts fade and die, 
 Worldlings may weep, but why should I? 
 Jesus still lives, and still is nigh. 
4 Though all the flocks and herds were dead, 
 My soul a famine need not dread, 
 For Jesus is my living bread. 
5 I know not what may soon betide, 
 Or how my wants shall be supplied; 
 But Jesus knows, and will provide. 
6 Though sin would fill me with distress, 
 The throne of grace I dare address, 
 For Jesus is my righteousness. 
7 Though faint my prayers and cold my love, 
 My steadfast hope shall not remove, 
 While Jesus intercedes above. 
8 Against me earth and hell combine; 
 But on my side is power divine; 
 Jesus is all, and He is mine!
