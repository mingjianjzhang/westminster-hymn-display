Title: FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD (因为神爱世人)
CCLI: 757

Verse 1 English:
For He gave His only Son
To die on Calv’ry’s tree
From sin to set me free;
Some day He’s coming back —
What glory that will be!
Wonderful His love to me!

Verse 1 Chinese:
因为神爱世人，
舍了独生爱子，
钉死在十架上，
使我脱罪权势。
有日，祂要再来，
何等尊贵、荣耀！
祂的大爱真奇妙！
