Title: NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE IRREGULAR METER (非我意愿乃你旨)
CCLI: 394

Verse 1 English:
Seeking the Lord Not my will but Thine be done,
But let the fullness of the Son Rule within this life that I have offered Thee,  Until everything I do
Becomes the thing that pleases You, Abba Father I would be a son indeed.

Verse 1 Chinese:
非我意愿，乃你旨，得以成全；让主丰满，
在我里面，作王掌权；阿爸、父阿，我将此生全奉献；  愿我所作，讨你心欢；
直等到，儿子实际，从我显现！
