Title: THIS IS MY REST FOREVER (“我已拣选了锡安)
CCLI: 746

Verse 1 English:
Psalms and Scripture Portions
This is My rest forever;
Here will I dwell,
For the Lord hath chosen Zion,
He hath desired it for His habitation.
He will abundantly bless her provision:
He will satisfy her poor with bread.
He will clothe her priests with salvation,
And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

Verse 1 Chinese:
诗 132:13~16
“我已拣选了锡安，
作我居所。
是我永远安息之所，
我要住这里，这是我所愿意。
我要使其中的粮食极丰满，
使其中的穷人都饱足。
我要使祭司披上救恩，
使圣民大声赞美欢呼。”
